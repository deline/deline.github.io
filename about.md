In a nutshellâ€¦ My name&#8217;s Deline Neo. I live in Sydney and am a Software Engineer. Java and Objective-C areÂ my poison with occasional smatterings in other areas/languages as needed. I&#8217;ve pretty much worked in technology related jobs all my lifeâ€¦ oh except if you count my first job ever which as as the paper boy (or in my sense girl).

For the longer breakdown feel free to keep readingâ€¦ ðŸ˜€

I have vague memories of first using a computer. I remember the green screen and DOS, but most of all I remember Hugo&#8217;s House of Horrors. I also remember a few years later getting the first family computer, a 486. That was the computer that I learned to code on.

In the early days I dabbled with HTML and web developed/designed whilst trying to learn how to program in JavaScript. Somehow along the way my high school computing teachers got wind of this and to this I am grateful for. I learnt a lot those 2 &#8211; 3 years both myself and from them that sometimes I&#8217;m still amazed at the amount achieved in those few years.

I went on to graduate from the University of Technology with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and started my professional career as a technology graduate at a multinational insurance company. Whilst on the grad program I decided development was my calling and cue my life as a software developer. These days I&#8217;m working as a Software Engineer/Team Lead at a financial institution specialising in acquiring.

Some of my other interests includeÂ keeping active, watching TV series and travelling.Â It&#8217;d be a dream to visit all 58 US National Parks. 11 down, there&#8217;s only 47 more to go!
