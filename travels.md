So I decided I had to add this page to my site as I love travelling and seeing new places and things. It amazes me at how many wonderful things in the world there are to see, yet at the same time I&#8217;m slightly saddened by the fact that I probably won&#8217;t get to see all the things I hope to see in my lifetime.

My fave places to travel are either in Asia or visiting natural wonders/sites of the world. I&#8217;ve visited and hiked in 11 of the 58 US National Parks and it would be awesome if I could visit them all in my life.Â If I had to pick my fave 2 countries I&#8217;ve visited, I&#8217;d have to say that USA and India win hands down for me. Probably closely followed by Vietnam.

My love of US National Parks started back in 2008 when I visited [Zion National Park](http://www.nps.gov/zion) and [Grand Canyon National Park](http://www.nps.gov/grca) in my first stateside trip ever. Until I made that trip I didn&#8217;t really have any desire to ever visit the USA. After that trip I was hooked, going back for 2 months in 2010 and seeing [Bryce Canyon](http://www.nps.gov/brca), [Arches](http://www.nps.gov/arch), [Canyonlands](http://www.nps.gov/cany), [Grand Teton](http://www.nps.gov/grte) and [Yellowstone](http://www.nps.gov/yell). Then for another month in 2012 to see [Sequoia](http://www.nps.gov/seki), [Kings Canyon](http://www.nps.gov/seki), [Yosemite](http://www.nps.gov/yose) and [Glacier](http://www.nps.gov/glac) National Parks.
