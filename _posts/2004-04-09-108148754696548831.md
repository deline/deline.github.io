Today is Friday, yet it feels like Saturday. I was actually going to start with &#8216;another saturday&#8230;&#8217; good thing I didn&#8217;t. Well today woke up at brekky rang lauren then trodded of to her place to look at her wireless network. Then trodded of to visit my grandma, which is kind of round the corner (well not quite, but close enough). Then I came home had some lunch and did more of DSP. Actually making progress. Once I write this last function and clean it up it should be done. I s&#8217;pose once my head got around it all, it wasn&#8217;t so bad. Though there is one point where I don&#8217;t get why I&#8217;m using the &. Mmm so kind of one down two more to go.
