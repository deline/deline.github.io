Weather is very hot&#8230; 31 degrees inside the house with all the blinds closed! Tomorrow is meant to be even hotter. Had a lazy day at home, lack of funds, heat and laziness getting the better of me. So been sitting in air conditioned room reading Scar Tissue the autobiography by Anthony Kiedis (guy from Red Hot Chili Peppers). It is a very interesting read. I remember I read the excerpt (first chapter I think) in a Good Weekend magazine a couple of months ago, and thought it was interesting. Well the book sure lives up to it. Very interesting read amazing stories/re-telling of situations/events in his life. Grab it and read if sometime if you have time&#8230;
