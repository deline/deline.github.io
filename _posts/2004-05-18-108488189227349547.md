Well today was my work and uni day. Anyways I left work and caught the bus to uni, to be rung by my friends &#8216;cos they were going to Harry&#8217;s Pies, so I met up and we went to Harry&#8217;s to get some food. Anyways they were at uni all day fixing up our assignment for the next submission. I&#8217;ll proabbly be working on it Thursday.

Anyways we got back to uni, and I finally got round to checking my DSPP marks&#8230; 20/20 better than I expected. Was expecting around 18 or so being a noob and all. Then in the lecture I had a brain wave of how to cut the lines of code out of the second assignment, which coincidentially if I&#8217;ve thought it out properly will fix/address the little issue I&#8217;m having that is causing some sections of code to be what I would call &#8216;not nice&#8217;. Will give that a go on the weekend.

Anyways I have to go read my databases assignment now so I know wtf is going on&#8230; have work again tomorrow&#8230;
