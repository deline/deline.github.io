Well this will be my last post till about Monday night as I&#8217;m off to the snow tomorrow. Well today was the dreaded day of uni results. I didn&#8217;t think they&#8217;d put them out that early &#8216;cos I remember Autumn 03 they weren&#8217;t out till 5pm and in Spring they weren&#8217;t meant to be either but came out a few hours early. But when I woke up to go to the toliet in the middle of the night (around 3am), curiosity got the better of me so I turned out my computer and had a check. And suprise they were out. All I can say is I passed stupid RE!!! I can&#8217;t believe it. I got a Credit for it&#8230; I have nfi how considering I needed 15/30 to pass and I guessed more than 15 questions. Overall: D, HD, HD, C. Definatley better than I thought. So I guess that&#8217;s another phase of my life that is now closed.

Anyways I have to go and pack my bag&#8230;
