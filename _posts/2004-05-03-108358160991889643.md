Oh yeah yesterday I wrote a little VB program to make m3u files based upon the files in a specified folder. Nothing to swish, but yeah used VB, and lol it seemed so long ago I&#8217;d used it. Same as Java, &#8216;cos I wrote a shell sort in it yesterday to better understand the concept. But I guess for must of what I&#8217;ve used before it comes back really quick. Well any programming in general &#8216;cos the main concepts are all the same.
