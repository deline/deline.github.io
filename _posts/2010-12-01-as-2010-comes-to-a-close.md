excerpt: |
  Well it's the 1st of December and the end of 2010 is almost here. I think that feeling of the year going by faster each year you get older definitely holds true.
  
  So what has 2010 been for me? 2010 has been a mixed bag of things. Some good, some not so good. But coming up to the end of the year I'd have to say for the most part things have worked out all right in the end. And I guess ultimately I'm happy with that :-) If I had to pick two highlights of the year, I'd reckon I'd have to pick the big trip of USA2010 and finally making a decision on my pottering.
  
  All in all, I'm looking forward to 2011! And if I don't post again before the end of the year... Merry Christmas & Happy New Year (though if you're reading this blog I'm fairly sure I'll see you before then :-p )
