&#8216;Twas designing a new layout in pure CSS using layers but have given it a break as I&#8217;ve wasted enough time already. So for now, will have to make do with a blogger template till I eventually get around to doing something which I guess will be in July sometime maybe. Or I may just go back to good &#8216;ole HTML&#8230; whichever really.

Why the fascination in re-doing something I never complete&#8230; well took the plunge and bought some real web space/hosting service. Go Daddy again, 49 AUD for a whole year 500MB disk space 25 GB of transfer per month, with PHP, MySQL and 100 Email accounts that are pop based. So no more spam on my optus account, &#8216;cos I&#8217;ve now moved to retrieving my mail from my domains pop account&#8230; if that makes any sense&#8230; but yeah I think I better actually do some real work now&#8230;
