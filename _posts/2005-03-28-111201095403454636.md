Site is moving along nicely. Wrote a little PHP script for a section, but I&#8217;ve got to fine tune it so the state changes are properly implemented. Right now there&#8217;s no real handling of different states which isn&#8217;t all that great.

BTW anyone know how I cam make salvinia grow quickly? Apparently it can double its spread in one week. I&#8217;m hoping mine does, so that I have some better ones to press/mount. I have to say though its one dirty plant, looks feral feels feral. Google salvinia molesta if you wanna have a squiz.
