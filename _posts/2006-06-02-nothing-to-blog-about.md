This week has been a pretty stock standard week. Missed the first comp game of touch because I had a last minute swap in days for my training course. Other than that the weather here has decided to get cold, The forecast is 17 degrees max temperature for the next week&#8230; I looked like an eskimo/snowman this morning going to work&#8230;
