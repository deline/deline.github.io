I got my uni results tonight/this morning. It&#8217;s weird &#8216;cos they publicise/tell us that they&#8217;ll be released at 5pm on the date, (as they always do each year), but release them at 12 midnight instead. Well they have for the last 3 semesters since they moved over to My Student Admin. So I went to bed at 10:30pm and when I woke up around midnight I had a squiz and woah behold they were online. Pretty stoked with the results. Strangely, my highest subject was my science subject which is heaps mad especially &#8216;cos it&#8217;s my non-IT elective and all. Even though in that exam I left alot of blanks where it asked for examples of plants. Other than that, apart from one subject which I thought I&#8217;d do a bit better (but still happy nonetheless), everything else is great. And back to sleep I go&#8230;
