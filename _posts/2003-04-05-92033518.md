Nothings up, just myself. I was reading an article in Spectrum today about the Looking For Alibrandi author, and she mentioned that she though the reason many people &#8216;clicked&#8217; with the book was because it was alot to do with how we as ourselves try to work out who we really are and our place in this wide world.
  
Then today I read a blog, which strangly enough is what I often feel.
  
I am my mind. And not being able to make some sense of it means that I&#8217;m losing it.
