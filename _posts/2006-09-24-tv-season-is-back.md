And how awesome it is already! Caught Jericho on thursday night and that looks somewhat promising and saw the first two eps of grey&#8217;s. Waiting for veronica mars now. Hmm at this trivia thing but waiting for Trish to rock up. I dont know anyone well not properly anyway. Silly me and my somewhat weirdness.
