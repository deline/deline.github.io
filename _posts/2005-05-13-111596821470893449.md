I&#8217;m impressed&#8230; I&#8217;ve just mounted my plants for my herbarium which is due next week and they look pretty good (hehe here&#8217;s to hoping the lecturer/markers think so too). It took me about 3 hours to mount 10 plants properly. You&#8217;d be surprised at how hard it is to mount the plants down. As their dry their pretty fragile, so gluing needed to be done carefully. Then some were slighly heavier/woody, so I had to tie them down with dental floss (i.e. sew them down)&#8230; but all&#8217;s good now. Strange thing though is quite a few of them still look green (well dark green), and they&#8217;ve been drying for well over 2 months now&#8230;. so hmm&#8230;
