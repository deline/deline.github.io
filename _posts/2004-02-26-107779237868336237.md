Oh the other previous entry still applies, but in other news, I&#8217;m going to Fleetwood Mac next Sunday night. Gotta love good &#8216;ole 2 for 1 deals that Ticketek pulls off every now and then. Yeah I s&#8217;pose they are an older band, but they sound kinda okay. And it&#8217;s kinda like a little present for my dad. He didn&#8217;t want to go for the usual price, $199 or $149 depending on the category for a SINGLE TICKET!!! So I told him about 2 for 1&#8217;s and he said if it happened, he&#8217;d then go. So I decided I&#8217;d pay because it&#8217;s in my budget now (as opposed to 2 x $149). And so yeah we&#8217;re going to go. Mmm yeah kinda like a present/gift. I s&#8217;pose I don&#8217;t say much about yeah thank yous and stuff. So I guess this is my own way of it, because he&#8217;s great even if sometimes weird to understand (but I&#8217;m eccentric too in ways, so we get along!). So on Monday have to pick up the Blink 182 tickets AND the Fleetwood Mac tickets! Wootles!
