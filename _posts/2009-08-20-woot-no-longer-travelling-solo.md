excerpt: |
  So I've gone from potentially 5 weeks of solo travel through Vietnam and Laos to now having company all of the way. Em's arriving in Laos on the morning I arrive and I managed to talk my dad into coming to Vietnam as he was thinking of visiting the relos in Singapore. So now he gets to spend 3 weeks backpacking it up the coast with me before going to Singapore for a week.

  I must say that since solo travelling can get lonely at times it's definitely tops that I won't be myself. Friends/family to share random train adventures, confusion and funny moments with is always so fun. Can't wait!
