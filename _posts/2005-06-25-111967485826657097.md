Wowee, Bloggers got a new feature&#8230; nice makes my life easier now. Anyways I&#8217;ve just finished a massive cleaning spree of my room. I&#8217;ve managed to de-dust the best as I can, but I think I forgot my keyboard as its still pretty dusty&#8230; I have so much junk in my room. Well not really junk but notes, books, reading material&#8230; I have a feeling it is the abudance of paper that contributes to the excessive dust problem my room always seems to have&#8230;.
