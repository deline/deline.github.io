This week is so so so so so so SLOW!&#8230;&#8230;.. Grrrr all the other weeks flew by but this week is like slowly floating by. I woke up this morning and felt like it was Saturday. Maybe time is slowing down.. but that&#8217;d only be relative apparently. Eek they can&#8217;t slow down that would be like so annoying. Maybe I&#8217;ll wake up tomorrow and my brain would&#8217;ve caught up with time, or something along that line. I&#8217;ve just written those two questions I had to write&#8230;. and their freaking hard&#8230;. and I only just remembered that I had to provide answers! Hmm maybe a marking scheme will suffice??? Haha:

 _Critically analyse the social and ethical issues and recommend measures Global Airlines can implement to prevent further possible security breaches._

What was I thinking?!? Now I&#8217;ll have to write like a 1 page essay or something&#8230; damn&#8230; oh well I always seem to give myself more than I need too.. but if I gave less it&#8217;d feel like I wasn&#8217;t trying and was achieving nothing of much benefit&#8230; so I guess it might be good or something.. stressful.
