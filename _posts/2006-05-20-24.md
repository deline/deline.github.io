For a while I&#8217;ve wanted to watch the earlier seasons (1 &#8211; 3) of 24. Yeh I know each season is basically the same &#8211; bad people try to ruin America, Jack Bauer has to save the day, but for some reason I like it. Anyways the other week I got my hands on the Season 1 set, and I&#8217;ve just sat through 3 episodes in a row&#8230; It&#8217;s interesting watching Season 1 having jumped on the bandwagon Season 4, everything seems so different. At least I can get the backstory now, on the whole Bauer/wife/daughter deal.
