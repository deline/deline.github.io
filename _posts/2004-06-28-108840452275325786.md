So today caught up with Sal and watched Touching The Void. I&#8217;d seen the previews numerous times but they didn&#8217;t make too much sense. The movie was actually pretty good. More like a doco style movie. But yeah it&#8217;s amazing what your mind and body will do when pushed to the absolute edge of no return.

What else happened today. Well was gonna visit grandma in the morning, but my dad rang me and I had to go unit sit for the tradesman but he never turned up!!! So looks like I will be unit sitting again Wednesday morning before work (school). And this time he better damn turn up &#8216;cos a) I ain&#8217;t waking up early for nothing and b) I finished reading my book so I&#8217;ll be sitting bored for who knows how long&#8230;

I think tonight will be &#8216;format&#8217; night&#8230;
