I know I&#8217;m a bit of a hypocrite posting this, because in a way bloggers are the new-age media. But what role does the media play in one&#8217;s [life](http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,16444105-2,00.html) and when is to much to much? Why when things happen to well known people they get plastered all over the tv, papers and internet, but when things happen to the average joe it doesn&#8217;t? The media takes fascinating interest into others lives, but do they fail to consider the effect they have upon the families and very people they pursue? I don&#8217;t know the answer to that one.
