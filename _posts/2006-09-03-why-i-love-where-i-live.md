As much as i sometimes complain about the crap public transport i really do love where i live. Its awesome to live in a suburb which has lots of parks, is near the water and is still relatively quiet. Being able to go on walks and bike rides in such a nice environment is something i often don&#8217;t appreciate enough which i really should. And for some reason this spring has made me notice these things. Maybe its the coming of summer i don&#8217;t know but its made me feel all happy.
