A few thoughts for today (really the last few days)&#8230;

Don&#8217;t you hate it when people write replies but they don&#8217;t put commas in the right places? It makes it really difficult for the reader to determine what is actually being said. Secondly, public humiliation is wrong and from my perspective rude, especially so when it comes from someone who should know better. As an observer, I was actually dare I say disgusted/disappointed at the way things were handled.
