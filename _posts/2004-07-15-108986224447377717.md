I have just been on the longest bike ride ever since like pre geek era. Was riding from 10am to about 1:10pm with only a approx 20 minute rest or so. Rode from Putney over to Olympic Park around Olympic Park, over to Newington then back home. Suprisingly it wasn&#8217;t too bad, as I guess the previous week cycling the Putney &#8211; Meadowbank loop a few times a week helped. Oh but it was so freezing in the morning that I was a loser and wore two pairs of pants yet was still cold!
