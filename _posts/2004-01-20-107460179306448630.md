Okay I am getting very confuzzled, and I&#8217;m doing it to myself!!! I can&#8217;t work the stupid swap around in my head (not related to programming), more physical swap, combined with 100+ related things to the swap, so hard to comprehend. Today, worked. &#8216;Twas longish but pretty okay/good I suppose. Got a fair bit of stuff to do these next few days, which is cool, get my brain back into functioning mode again &#8211; which it needs. Other than that yeah&#8230; forgot to pick the watch up for dad this afternoon &#8216;cos finished of like 4.20 and totally forgot, plus thr service centre would&#8217;ve probably been closed by then methinks&#8230; ah well, would&#8217;ve been stuck in afternoon peak traffic otherwise. And now I need to go to sleep&#8230; goodnight.
