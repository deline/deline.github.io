Last night I went to bed really early because I was tired and not feeling all that great, but once I was in bed for some reason or another I started reading. Anyways I soon got bored and fell asleep. But during the night I felt pretty sick. I was really hot but when I kicked some of the blanket off I was freezing cold even though my head felt heaps hot. And my head was feeling funny like a headache but without the pain. So woke up and stumbled out for a drink except it made me feel even worse so I took some panadol and stumbled back to bed and tried to sleep but couldn&#8217;t. Eventually I did because I woke up late today&#8230;
