Mmm Fleetwood Mac was okay yesterday. It was very long. Oh also yesterday I got like 3 albums for $7 bucks each. Lol thats like 3 for the price of 1. How? Went to DFO and Sanity had these bins of CD&#8217;s with no cases, just the CD&#8217;s in slip sleeves. So I spent some time digging through a few of them. I would&#8217;ve bought a whole lot more I found, but lack of funds meant I kind of couldn&#8217;t. Anyway what did I get? AFI&#8217;s Sing The Sorrow (that was only released this year!), Millencolin &#8211; Pennybridge Pioneers and Sugar Ray &#8211; 14:59. Woot. Mmm I had a d/l of Pennybridge Pioneers, but still bought it, &#8216;cos its not the same as the real thing methinks.

Ahh&#8230;. I love _Penguins and Polar Bears_! Anyways might get going have uni today, but don&#8217;t have to leave for another hour and a bit.
