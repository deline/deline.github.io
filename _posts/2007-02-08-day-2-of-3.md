So I woke up at 4am today to meet my driver at 4:30am. Except he was a bit late, so I kinda sat in the dark out the front for a bit. Oh speaking of early, so I walked down and the front doors were locked. But there was the guy sleeping on the chair. And clearly I had to wake him up. So I&#8217;m like &#8216;Hello&#8217; etc etc but the guy didn&#8217;t wake up. And then I&#8217;m like do I poke him or something? So I resorted to prodding the pillow which kind of worked.

Anyways so yep went out to Angkor Wat to watch the sunrise. Got there super early, but it was good cos it ment I could find myself a prime position. I had my mp3 player with me so I just sat around listening to music till it started getting bright.

Pretty awesome hey?:

At the Ta Phrom (otherwise referred to as the Tomb Raider one):
