excerpt: |
  I've decided to start a vent category appropriately tagged '<a href="http://delineneo.com/category/blog-tags/gripes">Gripes</a>'.

  For my first posting on this new site, I have to vent about public transport.. and the stupidity that a near empty bus does not stop at a city stop during peak hour when signalled. Add to the fact that it is the only bus route into where I live and you have a pretty annoyed passenger (or lack thereof really, considering I never got on it).

I&#8217;ve decided to start a vent category appropriately tagged &#8216;[Gripes](http://delineneo.com/category/blog-tags/gripes)&#8216;.

For my first posting on this new site, I have to vent about public transport.. and the stupidity that a near empty bus does not stop at a city stop during peak hour when signalled. Add to the fact that it is the only bus route into where I live and you have a pretty annoyed passenger (or lack thereof really, considering I never got on it).

Maybe those new proposed [&#8216;Ferrari&#8217; trains](http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/ferrari-trains-for-sydney/2008/03/18/1205602358560.html) might save the day (and traffic?)&#8230; Except with the Tcard debacle I&#8217;d love to see what ticketing plan they have in mind for this new transport mode.
