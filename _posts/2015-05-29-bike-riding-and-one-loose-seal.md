So I made an Arrested Development reference, but it&#8217;s true there was (kind of) a loose seal. But I&#8217;ll get to that laters.

So with our scrapped Chinatown plans replaced with Stanley Park, we slept in a bit this morning before heading out and having breakfast/coffee. I don&#8217;t know if I just haven&#8217;t had a great bagel yet, but to me bagels are just a tad to dense for my liking. After eating we caught a bus down towards Stanley Park to hire some bicycles. Public transport buses were like the LA ones here, exact change required. Throw your coins in the box get a bit of paper, driver never handles the money. I wonder if that would work in Sydney or would people be outraged they had to have the correct funds?

After hiring the bikes we began our casual bike ride around Stanley Park, following the seawall. Unlike the botanical gardens in Sydney the cycle path is actually separated from the pedestrian footpath, and it goes one way only. Best thing? People actually follow this so there&#8217;s no pedestrians in the cycleway and vice versa.<figure id="attachment_1230" style="width: 474px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

It was along the ride that we spotted a lone seal alone in the water. I kind of managed to get a snap of it&#8230;<figure id="attachment_1228" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

After making it round to the other side we followed the seawall further long and crossed over a bridge to get to Granville Island. Weren&#8217;t intending to go to the island, but with the bikes and nothing else planned it seemed like a good enough thing to do. Granville Island marked our refuelling stop. I don&#8217;t really drink beer usually, but I tried 2 of the taster size beers. The raspberry beer was light and fruity, much better than my other choice.<figure id="attachment_1232" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Once done, a quick look around the island then it was back on the bike to ride uphill back over the bridge and into downtown. The cycle path system in downtown was also pretty great as well. Separated from the road and footpaths and the light sequences actually changed with the traffic lights!

Tomorrow we&#8217;re off onto the 7 day cruise of Alaska. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;ll be much blogging as the internet on the ship is ridiculously expensive and I&#8217;m not sure what the free WiFi situation will be like in the ports we visit. So if there&#8217;s no updates, the next one should be when we&#8217;re in Anchorage in a week or so.
