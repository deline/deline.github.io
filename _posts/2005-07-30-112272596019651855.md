Argh I think I&#8217;ve come into contact with something I&#8217;m allergic too (contact dermatitis?) my face is super itchy and reddish. Went to the doctor &#8216;cos yep its itchy, itchy, itchy and got prescribed some cortisone cream which actually relives the itching whilst it&#8217;s effects last&#8230; argh, argh double argh&#8230;

Well I watched that movie I got finally today. Meh everyone else who was at home didn&#8217;t get it. Theres so much more to the movie then the storyline alone. And yes the protagonist Michele ends up getting shot. They never actually inform you whether he dies or not, and I guess that&#8217;s up to the viewer. IMO I think he does and the scene where Filippo and Michele reach out for each other is probably a symbolic reversal of when Filippo thought he was dead and Michele was his guardian angel.

Anyways off to bed to read, then tomorrow bike ride for lunch&#8230;
