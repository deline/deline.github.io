A volcano has started erupting in Iceland &#8211; read about it [here](http://olympics.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=scienceNews&storyID=6686483).

Iceland lies directly ontop/between a mid ocean ridge, so yeah I guess tectonic activity is to be expected (wow I remembered something from high school science :-p). Still kinda cool seeing the ash explode out the top on TV.

Well SDP is \*almost\* over. the most stressful parts are, with the presentation today. Now just the acceptance review to go next week then we&#8217;re all free&#8230;well till exams anyway.

Argh I have an assignment due tomorrow 6pm&#8230; think I should go finish it now&#8230;&#8230;
