Well I&#8217;m just a tad confused about what to do right now and my stomach is feeling weird for some reason, but I&#8217;ll have it all worked out by tomorrow (the confused bit that is). In the past weeks I wasn&#8217;t sure whether to stay at the school job and not take the uni job or do both, but now after getting a reply I&#8217;m up in the air. The uni job sounds cool, and it&#8217;ll be good for me and at the same step a chance to see whether I&#8217;d like to go down the teaching path in the future, but school is just as ace as well (plus its nearby). Well I&#8217;m gonna reply to the email tomorrow saying &#8216;Yes&#8217; anyway, but before I do so, I&#8217;ll let school know of my plans, as its courtesy to do so and yep. Wow&#8230; quite surprised, as I because I hadn&#8217;t got an email before I went away I thought I was unsuccessful, and hence didn&#8217;t chase the email because of the whole belief in fate and that things happen for a reason and blah blah blah you know the saying.

Anyways moving along, I&#8217;ve spent the last 2 days adjusting to land&#8230; instead of &#8216;sea legs&#8217; it&#8217;s &#8216;land legs&#8217;, but I should be adjusted back to normal by tomorrow &#8211; yay! Kinda funny as I&#8217;ve been so tired at work the last 2 days and I haven&#8217;t done that much lifting!

I&#8217;m going to sleep now, &#8216;cos I have to do the school run on my way to work tomorrow, good night, sleep tight, don&#8217;t let the bed bugs bite (whatever they may be)&#8230; I look forward to tomorrow, the unexpectedness that has arisen&#8230;&#8230; oooh sounds like a movie&#8230;. well you&#8217;ll all just have to stay tuned to see how the ending goes&#8230;
