Been playing the piano a bit recently. It&#8217;s something different, and it sorta lets me get away from this world. I haven&#8217;t really played it seriously since like Year 9/10. Beethoven&#8217;s Moonlight Sonata is pretty good, its the piece I&#8217;m working on right now. Though after it all, I&#8217;ll probably end up with RSI in my left hand cos i have to strecth my fingers a whole octave! It&#8217;s weird, these last few days I&#8217;ve been listening to songs from around 4 years ago. Been listening to Ben Folds Five and Semisonic. Yeah it&#8217;s slighty different to the usual style, but they have melodic tunes, which help you escape from the world. And you&#8217;ve just gotta love Brick by Ben Folds Five&#8230; _It&#8217;s six am, day after Christmas, throw some clothes on in the dark, the smell of cold&#8230;_ The piano in Brick is just freaking good!
