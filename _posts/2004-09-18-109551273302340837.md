Well just got back from the movies. Went to see Suddenly 30 with some friends. Was pretty good, a bit slow at the start though. Some parts of the movie made me think back some years though. After movies decided on what to eat, ended up at Oporto&#8217;s for junk (if that&#8217;s what its called?). Bummed chatting for a bit then trish got picked up, then drove emily home, them myself home.
