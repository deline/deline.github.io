[Music to their ears: Indie rock is the rage on TV&#8217;s hottest new shows &#8212; but the competition can be fierce](http://www.nj.com/columns/ledger/sepinwall/index.ssf?/base/columns-0/1138513269303820.xml&coll=1) And I would have to agree with this article 100%. Part of the reason I&#8217;m hooked on my current list of hot TV shows to watch (read: GA) is in part due to the music. My weekly viewing exposes me to a whole lot of new artists and tunes to listen too that I probably never would have heard of before.
