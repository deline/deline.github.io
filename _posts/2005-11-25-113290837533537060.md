I locked myself out of the house this morning which kinda sucked &#8216;cos I had to get to work and I had no house, garage or car keys &#8216;cos I forgot to put them in my bag. But by some weird chance of luck my brother had a friend staying over, so I tried to ring my home but no-one picked up. Then I had to madly try ring my brother and hope he picked up to get him to ring his friend. And yep in the end I managed to get my keys. Then after that I had to make like 3 trips between the driveway and the house because I kept on forgetting things!
