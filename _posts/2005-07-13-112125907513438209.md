So I&#8217;m still reading [Where The Truth Lies](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812972236/qid=1120986318/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_ur_1/102-0026276-9224948?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) and it&#8217;s been taking me quite a bit longer than I thought. It&#8217;s a brillant read &#8211; full of deception, twists and turn yet with moments of wit that make me laugh out loud at the sheer stupidity/humour of the scene. A book where I&#8217;m definatley interested in seeing it&#8217;s big screen portrayal in order to experience another&#8217;s perception of the storyline.

On another note, I&#8217;ve finally mamaged to track down the author and title of the excerpt I read in the paper on the weekend. It was difficult and took me 3 days to eventually track it down (not 3 full days, but 3 days with a moment of serious Googling). It didn&#8217;t help that I didn&#8217;t remember the author or title, but now I&#8217;ve found it, I&#8217;m probably going to buy it tomorrow. It&#8217;s called [Rowing Without Oars](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/071956686X/026-5998401-9211600) and it&#8217;s a basically a memoir written by the author from her diagnosis with ALS to her eventual death. From what I read, it was a very evocative and touching story&#8230; More on it later on (when I get around to reading it&#8230;)
