First things first, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are coming to Australia&#8230; woot&#8230; except their not playing Big Day Out &#8216;cos they got &#8216;too big&#8217;. That&#8217;s what happened with Coldplay and this year&#8217;s BDO. The prices are pretty steep, but it&#8217;ll be worth it&#8230; &#8216;cos when will you get to see them again? So it looks like next Friday will be either a early morning wait, or intense use of the F5 button of the keyboard.

Now to the second part about random people&#8230; maybe a month or so back I started noticing this person at the end of the street, who sat there on the kerbside all day&#8230;. everyday. And they still do it now &#8211; well okay they&#8217;ve kinda moved to standing &#8211; but it&#8217;s freaky nonetheless. So went I went for a jog the other day and had to jog pass the person I was like &#8216;damn I hope nothing happens to me&#8217;, &#8216;cos even everyone else has started to notice this mystery person&#8230;
