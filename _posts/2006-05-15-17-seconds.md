Okay like how good was that episode of Grey&#8217;s?!? Not to mention there&#8217;s the two hour season finale tomorrow night! Looking at the ABC schedule, there showing this ep again plus the next lot back to back &#8211; 3 hours of Grey&#8217;s?!?

But seriously it looks like it&#8217;s going to be a good end to the season&#8230;. crazy Izzie was somewhat predictable, but \***** getting shot? That was out of nowhere&#8230;. and it looks like we&#8217;re going to be in for a showdown with the triangle&#8230; oops quadrilateral or whatever sided shape it is up too these days.

_ETA: another reason why this ep was good &#8211; they played [Somewhere A Clock Is Ticking](http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=3530822107858507334) by Snow Patrol_
