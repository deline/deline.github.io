Went driving again today. Was so much better today. This was &#8216;cos my dad decided to stick a book under the mat to raise my foot a bit higher, as I was saying yesterday that it felt as if my foot was to short, and when I went to release the clutch it was like &#8216;floating&#8217; which made it hard to control. So yeh, I&#8217;m a tiny bit better today. He actually asked me if I wanted to drive home from Homebush but I didn&#8217;t want to, &#8216;cos I can&#8217;t start properly on hills.. I roll back a bit, and some cars have a habit of getting just a little too close. Can&#8217;t go driving tomorrow though, &#8216;cos my dad is going fishing.

Other than that, went and hired some DVDs today&#8230; was gonna go movies, but then decided couldn&#8217;t be bothered, as it was going to be crowded, and that I could hire alot more DVDs for the cost of a movie ticket. So anyways, yeah hired 3 movies. Just finished watching Black Hawk Down, and will probably watch another later tonight or something.
