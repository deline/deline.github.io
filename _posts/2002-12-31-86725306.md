Well I went driving today. I&#8217;m still bad but I think I&#8217;m alot better than the last time I tried. At least this time I didn&#8217;t stall on the first start. Though my dad thinks I&#8217;m still shocking and not any better, but that just dad being dad. I still got problems coordinating feet with release clutch press accelerator thing. Eh looks like I&#8217;ll have to practice alot more. Other than that today I&#8217;ve gone for a walk, gone out for lunch, burnt and packaged CDs, been to the post office and now bumming at home. I&#8217;m not doing anything this New Years. Sort of can&#8217;t be bothered, as if I did, I&#8217;d just go to the city, which is the same I&#8217;ve done every other year&#8230; and well I&#8217;m just can&#8217;t be bothered this year. Hmm I must sound boring. Actually we have this dinner to go to tonight, and I didn&#8217;t want to go, rather wanted to stay at home, but now I&#8217;ve decided to go. Mum was getting shitty at me cos I didn&#8217;t want to go. But my grandma will be there (I think), and my aunt who&#8217;s going back to America in the next couple of days or so. Just gonna bring stuff to amuse myself with&#8230; MD, digital camera and a nice big fat book. I wonder if I can bring my pillows and blanket too? (only kidding).
