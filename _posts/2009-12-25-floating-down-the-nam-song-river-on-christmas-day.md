excerpt: |
  Spent today floating down the Nam Song river in a tube. Took quite a while as some parts we had to paddle and I was terrible at paddling - blame it on the short arms I say.

  Other than that Vang Vieng is the most backpacker-ish place in Laos we've been so far, but it's not overly too backpacker-ish as I had expected. Going to be here another day then up to Luang Prabung for a few days and them I'm back to Hanoi and onwards to Sydney via Singapore.
