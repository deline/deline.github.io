Well it&#8217;s been a week since my last entry, or thereabouts anyway. I&#8217;ve been pretty much working had a couple of days off to catch up with one of my good buddies, who&#8217;s moved to Coffs to go to uni. She left today. It&#8217;s kinda surreal even though it doesn&#8217;t feel like it, only cos it still hasn&#8217;t really clicked that they&#8217;ve gone for the better part of a year. Still there will be holidays to catch up I guess.
  
Next week I won&#8217;t be working much, because I&#8217;m off to I.T. Camp. Where it is, I haven&#8217;t got a clue, so really, it should be called Mystery Camp. Rock up to Haymarket on Monday and find out.
  
I&#8217;m kinda tired these days. I think it&#8217;s to do with air conditioning. I&#8217;m exposed to too much of it. Probably more so at home than work. I come home, drop my stuff, go to my room, hit the remote, and settle down. I need to get a good nights sleep tonight, as tomorrow I have to drive a bit and probably go Macquarie to do some shopping. More groceries than the &#8216;girly&#8217; kind of shopping though. If I don&#8217;t do it no-one will remember. What&#8217;s on the list&#8230; hmm&#8230; hair conditioner, toliet paper, cordial&#8230;.. i sound boring.
