excerpt: |
  Well not necessarily of the bad kind. I've embarked on my journey to fix the non-meeting front teeth which have resulted in having to get 4 premolars extracted. Got 2 done a few weeks ago and the others just came out this afternoon. So I'm kind of sitting here with a numbed left face and I won't go into the rest of the detail...

  Hoping the pain I have won't be as bad/intense as before. The first 2 extractions resulted in me having close to 2 weeks intense jaw pain and tension. Worse than when I had all 4 wisdom teeth extracted at once! That was nothing compared to this.

  And to add to today, tomorrow I have to see the orthodontist at 7:30am for separators... so I think pain will be the word of choice for the next week or so...
