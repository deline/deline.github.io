Just watched this [doco on Google](http://www.sbs.com.au/cuttingedge/index.html?id=1372) on SBS. Was pretty interesting, as it also brought up a few interesting topics regarding privacy and the storage of personal information by google. I&#8217;m still sitting on the fence on that one, as I believe that to some extent we do have a bit of power in our choice of whether or not we use the tools/features provided by Google.

Watching this doco, brought me back to the (good?) old days. It had this montage of search engines etc from ages ago. Any pre-Googlers remember the days of [AltaVista](http://www.altavista.com/). Not to mention Dogpile, MetaCrawler etc&#8230;. ahhh the nostalgic memories&#8230; (well not quite)&#8230;

Either way, I&#8217;m still all for vouching that &#8216;Google is your friend&#8230;&#8217;
