If I went to yet another [Snow Patrol gig](http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/local/9268/Snow_Patrol_return_down_under)??? I know I complain about them selling out, but it&#8217;s all about the music in the end. But is 3 times in just over a year just a little bit extreme? To be exact, it would be something like 1 year, 1 month and about 2 weeks&#8230; (not that I was actually counting or anything)&#8230; and I would just be getting my hopes up that they play old stuff, which never happens&#8230;
