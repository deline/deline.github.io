Woot&#8230; it&#8217;s all finally happening. I&#8217;m going to India in December! I fly out on the 3rd of December and should be back around the 30th. I&#8217;d love to travel longer but my ticket is only open for 35 days and I want to get back before the 10th of Jan anyway to ensure everything is all in plan before I start work. Flying SQ again, so kicked myself that I didn&#8217;t join their KrisFlyer scheme last year. If I did, I&#8217;d only have been just under 3000 short for a ticket from Singapore to Vietnam, Cambodia or Thailand! >.
