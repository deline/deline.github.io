So just kinda got back from the Bayview from dinner + drinks do because Em&#8217;s going away. Most people left early I think around 9 or so because they had work tomorrow, but a small group of us stayed on. Then my brother and his friends came up to join us for some reason, and we ended up having an amusing night. Then later on we tried to play flip the coaster and catch it but I sucked at it majorly. Hehe then as it was a quiet night there one of the bar guys came over to give us a whole stack more of coasters to play with and joined in for a bit. Then it was on to coaster snap and other randomness. All in all, a great night had by all.
