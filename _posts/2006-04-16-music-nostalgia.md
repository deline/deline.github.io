There&#8217;s currently a few ads on tv using the New Radicals song You Get What You Give as the backing track/music. That got me reminiscing about songs from the mid to late 90&#8217;s that were hits or somehow struck a chord with me&#8230; and so in my late night ramblings, here&#8217;s a listing of some songs in no particular order

  * Harvey Danger &#8211; Flagpole Sitta
  * Third Eye Blind &#8211; Semi-Charmed Life
  * The Mighty Mighty Bosstones &#8211; The Impression That I Get
  * Oasis &#8211; Wonderwall
  * The Verve &#8211; Bittersweet Symphony
  * Travis &#8211; Why Does It Always Rain On Me
  * The Mavis&#8217;s &#8211; Cry
  * The Living End &#8211; Prisoner of Society
  * Ben Folds Five &#8211; Brick
  * Eskimoe Joe &#8211; Sweater
  * Rhubarb &#8211; Exerciser
  * Happyland &#8211; Hello
  * Spiderbait &#8211; Calypso
  * Manic Street Preachers &#8211; If You Tolerate This Then Your Children Will Be Next
  * Fuel &#8211; Shimmer
