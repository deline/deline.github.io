I&#8217;m tired and it&#8217;s my formal tonight. I wonder if I&#8217;ll fall asleep at the table? That would be a first.

The night will probably be interesting. Being a girls school, i&#8217;m \*sure\* there will be a lot of gossip going on, you know the &#8216;look at her dress it looks so.&#8217; to the &#8216;omg who is that person&#8230;&#8217; I&#8217;m having lots of trouble fitting all my stuff into my bag. I don&#8217;t know how people do it. I only just fit my phone + money thingo&#8230; I&#8217;m still contemplating whether or not to wear my glasses. I would prefer to bring them rather than have to choose between wearing them or not, but the thing is, they just don&#8217;t fit in my bag. I have to go now&#8230; got stuff to do&#8230; blah&#8230;. photos will come soon.
