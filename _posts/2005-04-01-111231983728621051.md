Some randomness, I went skating today&#8230; which I have not done in like 2 years! Went over to the park at Lane Cove&#8230; new setup is heaps better than old, though I wish the mini was still rideable&#8230; oh well.

Do you ever get that feeling when listening to music that life is great, yet at the same moment of feeling that greatness theres a surge of how you could just no longer exist and it&#8217;d be great as well? It&#8217;s kind of like they cancel each other out really.
