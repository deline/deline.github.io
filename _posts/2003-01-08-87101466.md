Hmm my movie watch list of the last 1 and a half weeks or so have so far included (in no particular order):

  * Black Hawk Down
  * AntiTrust
  * Amelie
  * Gone In 60 Seconds
  * Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#8217;s Stone
  * Tomb Raider

Oh in other news, went and saw Sticky last night. It was cool, fireworks were good. Hehe, I bet the show was an excuse for fireworks. Still it was mad, and I wish I&#8217;d brought a camera. Well I was charging it in the afternoon then I decided not to bring it in case I got rolled.
