Powderfinger was on last night. It was pretty good. And they actually played for quite long. I must say it was kinda cool looking down on the standing floor area as it looked cool (by the time we bought tickets they were sold out &#8211; and this was the day they came out!). Oh and I kinda found out Friday night like midnight-ish time that I&#8217;m going away on hols in Feb from the 8th to the 15th.

This morning me and my dad went for a drive to Aldi at Strathfield to have a look and buy stuff &#8211; see if it was noticable saving and the quality. Though must say some stuff is cheaper and some is around average. There&#8217;s these biscuits they sell that are a very good imitation of Tim Tams&#8230; and juice was kind of cheapish.

But this blog shall end for tonight&#8230;. as I&#8217;m kinda tired&#8230; came home last night almost 1, then bummed on my comp for around 30 min then went sleep. Waking up early today didn&#8217;t exactly help.
