Hmm I&#8217;ve been posting more than once a day recently. I really should set the code up, so that posts are under a day heading with the time for each sub post (if that made any sense). I&#8217;ve gotten into my exercise routine. Saturday and Sunday I walked/jogged and today I rode my bike. I&#8217;ve decided though I&#8217;ll alternate between walking/jogging and bike riding, so tomorrow morning is walking/jogging day. Speaking of which I&#8217;ve got to clean my proper running shoes&#8230; I think they&#8217;re collecting dust somewhere&#8230; will have to give them a good hose and scrub then leave them in the sun, so it better not rain tomorrow. Tomorrow however, is when I&#8217;m going to start driving again. I shoudl apply my determination to my driving attempts as well. If I&#8217;ve been able to tell myself to study/work hard all year, and get up early to exercise because I really want to, then seeing as I really do want my licence, I should make an effort there too rather then procrastinating over when I&#8217;m going to get around to learning. Hmm that was one long winded sentence. But yeah thats for now&#8230;
