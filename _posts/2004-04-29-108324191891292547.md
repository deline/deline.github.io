Haha I got a bank statement today. It said deposits were $4000 and something, and then for withdrawals it was $5000 and something&#8230; lol I spent more than I deposited?!? That may explain why my $$$ is declining.

Got 8GB to waste before the month is up, anyone got any suggestions??? Just used a bit less 500 odd up downloaded some updated versions of PHP, MySQL, phpMyAdmin etc.
