Well I ended up staying up till almost 3am. Pretty pleased caught almost all the sets I wanted to see + more, except for Snow Patrol &#8211; ended up playing round 4:30am I think &#8211; which I somehow woke up to catch the last song on the radio. Sets I saw: U2, Coldplay, Stereophonics, Dido, Muse, Green Day, Travis and bits of REM and Black Eyed Peas.

Highlights&#8230; Coldplay and Richard Ashcroft performing Bittersweet Symphony, Stereophonics with Local Boy In The Photograph, Muse&#8217;s set; oh and Bill Gates at London&#8217;s concert was a surprise for me.
