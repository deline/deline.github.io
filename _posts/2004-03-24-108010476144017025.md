Mmm in my post on Saturday I forgot to write how we went fishing. Dad caught a bream, pretty big size too. Me and my brother however lost a massive fish. Like when the fish took the bait, the whole rod tipped upside down and almost fell into the water. We got it, and we didn&#8217;t know what to do properly, and then the line broke üôÅ and yeah it was huge&#8230; trust the time a big fish gets hooked, my dad&#8217;s somewhere else.

In other news, worked yesterday and today. Pretty okay, normal&#8230; bit duller compared to previously more administrative based in a sense. Should do, as have stuff to do for uni etc. Post maybe again in a few days&#8230; who knows&#8230;
