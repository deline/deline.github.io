I got my ITV assessment back yesterday. It was pretty okay, okay it was good, but sometimes I do wonder if it&#8217;s of HSC standard? You know questions that float around in your mind like a leaf caught in a wind current. This weekend I&#8217;m hoping to get some more of my EES assignment done, and maybe some more of my SDD one. But I really should write up more notes for my Information Systems and Databases test next week. Yeah I know I&#8217;m stressing uneccessarily, but you never know, and there is always that little fear of failing, I mean not that I&#8217;d fail (hopefully not anyway), but the fear of not doing as well as I should be (muphey&#8217;s law &#8211; anything that can&#8217;t happen, will happen!) Anyway instead of wasting time with my Blog, I think I better do something more constructive.
