Today was my first free day in absolutley ages, so I was going to ride over the RGHS to drop of some forms then come back home. I was procrastinating when I woke up whether to drive or ride then made my mind up, because I realised if I didn&#8217;t actually ever do what I wanted to do, I&#8217;ll never ever get it done. So I packed my gear (water, bike pump, snack etc), went and got my bike and the front tyre was flat so I took it to the servo and filled it up. I was thinking that was odd at the timem &#8216;cos the back tyre was still full. Lucky I decided to go by home, to get my bike lock. Anyways so I come out, and I hear the air hissing out of the front type&#8230;. I&#8217;ve got a puncture&#8230; Oh No! Bike ride and get exercise plan was ruined&#8230; and I was relegated to the car for the trip over to drop the forms of&#8230;. so now the options are, fix the tube&#8230; or go with my urge and buy a new bike (and use the puncture as an excuse???)&#8230;
