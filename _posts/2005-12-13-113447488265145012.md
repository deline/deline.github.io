Well the rest of yesterday went and checked out the City Palace Museum. Then in the afternoon went with Mel whilst she got her palm read. It was an interesting experience nonetheless. Then after that had an early dinner and bummed on a roof top cafe reading and watching the sun set. It was a super early night for me yesterday I fell asleep at 8 something woke up read for a bit then fell back asleep again.

Today went on a road trip about 2 hours out of Udaipur to see a Jain Temple. It was made out of marble with intricate carvings everywhere. On the way back got stuck in traffic as they were doing some mine blasting along the route.

Tomorrow it&#8217;s another roadtrip to some small village town. Have to charge up my MP3 player for the road trip.
