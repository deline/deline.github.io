Sydney traffic is so random at times&#8230; sometimes you can get to the city in 30-40 minutes, other days it stretches from an hour to an hour and a half. Today was one of those days&#8230; and it had to be a Monday as well where the weather was all grey. You know that weather where you&#8217;d rather be at home. It&#8217;s times like these that I wish I lived on a train line. At least the train can&#8217;t get stuck behind a thousand other cars on a traffic jammed 3 lane road for the majority of it&#8217;s journey.
