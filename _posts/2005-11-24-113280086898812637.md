Okay so there&#8217;s not really much to post about. I did my last exam on Tuesday. It was kind of okay I suppose. The first question was good, the other ones I am not quite sure because I don&#8217;t think I phrased my answers very well&#8230;

Anyways I&#8217;m at uni now. My last day of work here, and then bye bye UTS. The next week is going to fly by. Working every day till next Wednesday, then a mad rush to organise stuff for my trip + last minute get togethers with peoples before we all go on our end of year (or for some whole year) journeys abroad. Plus Oasis gig is on this coming Monday night, so can&#8217;t wait for as it&#8217;s one more strike off my list of UK bands I want to see, with only 2 remaining&#8230;

As for what I&#8217;ve been doing with my spare time&#8230; it hasn&#8217;t really been spare, &#8216;cos yeah I&#8217;ve had to work Wed/Thurs and will continue to do so. Hopefully I can get a bit of bike riding in amongst it all. On the upnote at least I&#8217;ve caught up on sleep so much so now I&#8217;m sleeping to much that I&#8217;m tired all day&#8230;
