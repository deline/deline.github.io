After spending ages trying to get my code to submit and driving myself insane in the progress all seems okay now. At first it wouldn&#8217;t even run/accept it (no feedback nothing), so posted a msg for help. Anyways turned out it was working, cos someone had similar probs. So I removed some code from my functions, and kept on submitting it a bit at a time till it accepted more and more. Now 8 out of 8&#8230; relieved. Now to fix up this layout stuff.
