Mmm so in the last 2 days I&#8217;ve formatted my lappie, and its all nice, clean and patched. At least that&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve got around to so far. Other than that been working, eh all that lifting etc must&#8217;ve given me some extra muscles or something (plus make me super dooper tired).

Oh today because of that random bus strike I had to drive my mum to work at Para so had to wake up at some crazy time&#8230; I spent most of my morning driving! &#8211; or so it seemed. Whilst driving there were people waiting at bus stops and I had the urge to wind the window down and yell out &#8216;bus strike!&#8217; but alas that is not something I would actually do&#8230;

But yeh nothing to great other than that. Tomorrow going to only work a half day, so after dropping Calvin, probably head to visit my grandma for a bit before going to work. Some stuff I need to finalise/get done before hols.
