I got my nice new toy yesterday&#8230;an RP114. It makes the perfect addition to my already abdundant series of nightlights on my cable modem. I now have another 6 flashing lights to go with the existing 5. The aliens are attacking me at night..hehehe. Anyway it&#8217;s pretty cool, cos if i really want, I can block my brothers Internet access, amongst other stuff such as blocking access to certain websites. Best part I reckon, is that you can set what times your allowed to go on the Net!
