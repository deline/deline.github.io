Well that&#8217;s one 25% asessment down for BPITS and another 3 to go. Me and jess decided to go in the first week. May as well get it over and done with and be at the wrath of looking like idiots being the first people. I think my half was pretty okay. Much better than I expected. Lol had cards with points but didn&#8217;t really read them rather deciding as I went which was kinda along what I was intending to talk about anyway.
