So my post has been a few hours delayed. Got home a bit after 11 ish I think. But then I soon fell asleep after unpacking my stuff, checking my email and having a shower. Woke up sometime after 5pm. Think I have hopefully caught up on the missing hours of sleep. So how was the cruise in the South Pacific. It was pretty good I s&#8217;pose, but I&#8217;m glad to be home, because a week seemed along time for me. I miss my CDs and music, my computer and I think even possibly working. Isle of Pines was very beautiful, it would&#8217;ve been nice to be there a few days more, just to snorkel more and swim around. Saw bits of Noumea, weather was very humid, water was warm but still nice, probably would&#8217;ve been better if we saw more of it. Oh and food, it was like non stop eating for the last seven days. Deinners were 5 course, after breakfast came lunch and after lunch came a mid afternoon nap&#8230; and also for me the pre dinner nap. I might or might not to a longer post later (or in a few days), but I have to go now &#8216;cos have to work tomorrow, and I&#8217;ve got some stuff to do first. Laters&#8230;
