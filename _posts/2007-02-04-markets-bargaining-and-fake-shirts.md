Kind of go together. I dropped by the Russian Market yesterday but didn&#8217;t really pick up anything. In the afternoon however, I managed to walk my way over to I think it was the Central Market.

Wandering around it was a lot of the same stuff, you know, bags, cushion covers etc (basically tourist stuff), so I headed into the clothes section&#8230; I&#8217;d seen a lot of guy business shirts, so started looking for some female ones&#8230; and subsequently left with 6 shirts&#8230;

Ohh what&#8217;s also awesome&#8230; tropical fruit at super cheap prices. Speaking of fruit.. yesterday evening I was down by the river and eating some guava with chili, salt and sugar (I think it was)&#8230; and so this little girl seller/part beggar (well you know asking for money, I don&#8217;t think she was actually homeless).. came by and started trying to sell&#8230; and I&#8217;m like nah.. but then offered her some of my fruit as I couldn&#8217;t eat it all&#8230; so then we kinda just sat for a while&#8230; I think I&#8217;ve got into a habit of offloading the food I can&#8217;t eat onto the kids&#8230; wonders if it&#8217;s a bad thing, but I think it&#8217;s better than giving them money. also gave half a breadstick to these boys&#8230; i wasn&#8217;t going to eat it anyway it kinda just appeared with my breakfast of omellete&#8230;

yep ordering for 1 is hard as whatever i order is always too much for me to eat&#8230;
