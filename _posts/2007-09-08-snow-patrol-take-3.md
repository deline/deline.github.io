So last night I went to my third Snow Patrol concert in a little over 13 months&#8230; when I&#8217;d heard they were touring again I was a little bit hesitant about going the third time, but when Em said she was going/wanted to go, I was like decision made, I&#8217;m seeing them. And am I glad I went or what&#8230; best gig out of the 3 by far. In fact I rate the 2nd gig (the Hordern one) lowest on the list. But yeah so awesome, I can live with probably never hearing them play anything from Songs for Polar Bears and When It&#8217;s All Over We Still Have To Clear Up.
