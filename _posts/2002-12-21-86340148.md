Woot! I was reading the paper today and then later I checked out the Board Of Studies website, and I got on the Top Achievers Course list for Software Design and Development. I came like 7th in the state for SDD&#8230; but you have to give a place either side, as there were 11 people mentioned as the top 10, which means 2 people tied somewhere. Still I was pretty surprised&#8230;

Hmm so yeh what did I do to celebrate.. nothing much really. yesterday my dad had to go out, so my mum, brother and me just went out for dinner, and today we&#8217;re having a seafood dinner at home. Yum prawns, oysters, salad and bread&#8230;. Fark I just remembered I&#8217;m supposed to be working today.. well from home.. but I&#8217;ve just wasted like 2 hours! Shite&#8230;
