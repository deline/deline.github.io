Sometimes things are heaps good&#8230; and everything feels right. But then the walls fall down and your left lying on the floor. Today was the last day of school, which was heaps cool. But I didn&#8217;t feel completley happy or sad either. Subdued I guess.
  
But then when your okay, an obstacle rises in front of you and the high you were on slips away. Everything is f$%^&d&#8230; One quarter of this house can&#8217;t understand that I&#8217;ve been waiting for this for three years and I&#8217;m not going to give up without giving it my best. Another quarter thinks everything is cool, but thats just scratching the surface. And what was just said I did not want to hear. If I don&#8217;t think of things I am fine&#8230;. so why did that last sentence need to be said?
