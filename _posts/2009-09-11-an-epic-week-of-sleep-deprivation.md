excerpt: |
  At home today on a day of after my epic week of sleep deprivation. Long story short, worked an overnighter over the weekend with a release and whilst things were smooth there were a few hiccups. And as I'm on out of hours support this week lucky me has had to wake up at like 4:45am three days in a row...
  
  But it's not all bad, learnt all about classloaders in the process which is good. Plus I now know the feeling of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Classloader#JAR_hell">Jar Hell</a>!
  
  Other than that I really have to get a roll on my travel googling. Otherwise before I know it it will be 11 weeks from now and I'll be wandering Saigon in a daze...

At home today on a day of after my epic week of sleep deprivation. Long story short, worked an overnighter over the weekend with a release and whilst things were smooth there were a few hiccups. And as I&#8217;m on out of hours support this week lucky me has had to wake up at like 4:45am three days in a row&#8230;

But it&#8217;s not all bad, learnt all about classloaders in the process which is good. Plus I now know the feeling of [Jar Hell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Classloader#JAR_hell)!

Other than that I really have to get a roll on my travel googling. Otherwise before I know it it will be 11 weeks from now and I&#8217;ll be wandering Saigon in a daze&#8230;
