Well I very almost side swiped a car whilst changing lanes in the pissing rain. My bad&#8230;. and sorry to the other driver. Though I did check my mirrors, blind&#8230;.. argh rain + headlights do not mix. Absolutley pouring it was. Torrential at one stage.

Anyway went and sae Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason. Pretty damn good. Heaps heaps different from the book though. If def had more funny parts than the first, but there were some bits which were over the topish. Some classic moments. Lol watch if if you get the chance.
