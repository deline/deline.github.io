So I somehow signed up to do some volunteer work &#8211; planting some trees. But you know, if we&#8217;re going to plant trees to help the environment, it&#8217;s kind of ironic if I drive there and actually let out more carbon dioxide. Hence the pedal power. Okay, so I probably need the exercise too but it&#8217;ll be cool&#8230;. gotta ride I think somewhere between 7-10KM to get there which isn&#8217;t to far&#8230; just coming home will be the painful part.
