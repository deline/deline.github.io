So knocked of work round 5ish and headed down to the [GPO](http://www.gposydney.com/) for some drinks with people from my new team. Must admit at times it&#8217;s odd being in a male dominated industry &#8216;cos it often involves lone females surrounded by guys&#8230; (which I suppose could be both a good and bad thing???)&#8230; Then after than it was on to [Bar 333](http://www.bar333.com.au/) to drop in on a mate&#8217;s farewell drinks thingo&#8230; except that he worked at Maq Bank&#8230; which isn&#8217;t exactly where I work. That said, it was good fun &#8211; the people I met we&#8217;re all really nice and I had a good time. Oh&#8230;.. and I actually downed a whole beer&#8230;. (big thing for me&#8230;&#8230; lol)
