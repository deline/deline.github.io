So this weekend was spent down in Canberra visiting/hanging with Em. Headed down Friday night after work on the bus. Some things I should remember for the future&#8230; when your friend tells you to bring a &#8216;warm jacket&#8217;, follow their advice and do so. Somehow the jumper I brought quite didn&#8217;t cut it, and it was rather cold in the capital. By cold, I mean borderline freezing, at least at night anyway. Thanks for lending me the much warmer jumper!

So the next day we went out and did touristy stuff. I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve only been to Canberra once in my life, and it was when I was like 8 or 9, so I don&#8217;t really know what we did then (if we did much?). Went to the National Museum of Australia then on to Floriade. After then we walked over to Parliament House and did a little tour of that. Once we were done there (or rather it was closing), we trudged back to the car then drove around the embassies (it&#8217;s actually got a tourist drive number attached). Soon after that saw us doing happy laps around State and Capital Circuit trying to get out of the circle. You&#8217;d think driving out of a circle is easy until you realise that the circle isn&#8217;t a complete circle and has loops which force you off it. Oh that and the map being large scale throws one off in the prediction of how far away a turn/exit is.

Today involved a brief walking expedition in the morning, before getting dropped of the bus station and making the journey back home.

As for the alpaca in the tiny red car, when we were leaving where we parked the car for Floriade, a red car with an alpaca&#8217;s head sticking out the window was spotted. Which at the time was complete hilarity (and even the driver of the red car knew so too). So stuck in a traffic jam to exit the car park, numerous people jumped out of their cars and jogged down the carpark to snap a photo of the alpaca. And so did I&#8230;
