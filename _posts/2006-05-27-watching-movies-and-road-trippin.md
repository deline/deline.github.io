So this week has been kind of hectic that I still somehow haven&#8217;t managed to catch the final 2 hours of 24. Hectic because I&#8217;ve somehow already landed up at the cinemas twice this week. Tuesday night went and saw The Da Vinci Code, then yesterday a very random last minute decision at 8pm resulted in me madly trying to eat noodles and change to make X-Men 3 at 8:20pm. We actually made it to Macquarie on time, but it was sold out, so we had to wait till 9:30 anyway. Next movie to catch when it&#8217;s release is the next instalment of the Pirates of the Caribbean series.

As for road trippin&#8217;, in about an hour and a half or so I&#8217;ll be road trippin&#8217; it up the F3 to somewhere before Newcastle for a mate&#8217;s birthday. Have picked a stash of CDs to take along for the drive&#8230; I might actually get around to listening to Stadium Arcadium which I bought a few days back but still haven&#8217;t heard&#8230;.
