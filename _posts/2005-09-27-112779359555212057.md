Sociology troubles me&#8230; more so when I have to relate such theories back to the IT industry. Sociology on it&#8217;s own is actually quite interesting as it explains a lot of things about the world around us and how we all interact and learn. But give me a 2500 word essay and suddenly I have writers block.

But yes&#8230; [somewhere a clock is ticking](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/snowpatrol/somewhereaclockisticking.html)&#8230; and before I know it the essay will be due.
