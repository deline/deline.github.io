Another Saturday morning&#8230; sitting here listening to music and typing up my notes. I&#8217;ve been up since 4am. Went over to Clifton Gardens for a fish. It was pretty sucky today no big fish around. Still it was good. Came back stopped at Macca&#8217;s to eat some food, then back home. In a lazy daydream mood today. Listening to Oasis&#8230; good stuff.

Tomorrow going to go to Yum Cha, just me and dad. It sounds slack to say this, but I don&#8217;t want to pay for my mum and brother. I shouldn&#8217;t say their not deserving, but it&#8217;s more that they won&#8217;t appreciate it. They don&#8217;t really seem to appreciate much in life (even though in two totally different contexts). Sometimes we all need to look outside our boundaries to see a bit more of what&#8217;s happening around us. I&#8217;m not saying what I&#8217;m saying is right, it&#8217;s just from my perspective. When you close your mind to everything but your own world, you miss alot of what appears before your senses. Yet when you open your eyes, theres always the fear of being used. I think next weekend I&#8217;ll drive out to The Gap or Clovelly/Coogee to watch the sun rise. I like the smell of cold morning air when the sunlight is just rising. It&#8217;s nice.

Anyway&#8217;s keep rockin ppls&#8230;
