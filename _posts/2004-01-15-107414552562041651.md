Today went surfing with Megan and Emily. I suck&#8230; badly&#8230; haha. I have no upper body and arm strength so it takes me like \*ages\* to paddle out, and then I miss half the waves &#8216;cos I don&#8217;t have enough power for that last paddle onto the wave. Ahh crappy eh? Well if my swimming routine goes to plan, and maybe some attempts at weights those muscles will get stronger. I just hope my arms don&#8217;t go all chunko muscley &#8216;cos they&#8217;re beefy enough from sport when littler. Funny thing is I think I got a bit burnt on my face, must&#8217;ve been the reflection of the water. Well that&#8217;s it for now.
