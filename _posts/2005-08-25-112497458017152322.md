One week no post. Yep life&#8217;s been busy, busy, busy. What have I been up to? Nothing fantastically brillant that it&#8217;ll make one sit back and go \*wow\*&#8230; I&#8217;ve paid been to-ing and fro-ing between uni and work. And I paid my airline ticket. I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s week 4 already. Uni is crazy, there is more assessments than usual and it&#8217;s 90% group work. The part I don&#8217;t like (well it&#8217;s okay but it&#8217;s meh), is that everything is pretty much random this semester, so we have to go through the whole group learning process from scratch again&#8230; which well is painful in a way.
