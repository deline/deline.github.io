I love old DOS games, now known as abandonware. There&#8217;s a sense of nostalgia as you hit hit the exe and the game loads up in its oh so great 256 colours. Who could forget Hugo&#8217;s House of Horrors, Hugo 2 Whodunnit? and Hugo 3, Jungle of Doom. Then of course theres the six Commander Keen games, Tetris and the list goes on. But Hugo rules. Hmm that&#8217;s probably because he was my very first exposure to a computer. Monochrome DOS box and the only command I knew was DIR&#8230;. btw don&#8217;t underestimate the game&#8230; I actually needed a walkthrough to pass all three of them.
  
Apart from that I&#8217;ve been writing notes for most of the day. I spend the morning summarising the rest of communcatiosn for IPT, the whole afternoon on Change for english, and now I&#8217;ve just summaise a bit more for SDD. Anyways I should get going, I should be studying!
