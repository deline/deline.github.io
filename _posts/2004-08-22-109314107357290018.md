Getting better. Not as puffy today, but still looking fat faced. I reckon each cheek swelled to like 2+ centimeters! Somehow me thinks I still will be looking like this tomorrow (uni) and tuesday (work). Which is a bummer &#8216;cos I was going to go out for dinner on Tues night for birthday, but if it doesn&#8217;t go down I can&#8217;t which is sucky &#8216;cos its more soup. I&#8217;d be able to eat if my stupid teeth would meet but no stupid swelling in way of teeth&#8230; grrr.

Does anyone want to buy me an iPod??? Mmm maybe next year I might get one&#8230; I think I own to many gizmos/gadgets already though.
