Oh forgot to write this the other day (yesterday???) but someone mentioned to me how they were out somewhere and they met someone who knows me? and the person said i was some wild/crazy/outgoing kinda person? or something along the lines&#8230; I think i missed something, or I don&#8217;t know the person&#8230; something about meeting them in a nightclub or bar or something. Well I guess that kinda confirms that I definatley don&#8217;t know the person&#8230; lol mmm the only &#8216;outgoing&#8217; (so it seems) place you&#8217;d find me is at some rock concert in the mosh and thats not like a regular occurance&#8230; blah&#8230; makes you wonder who random ppl who know you really are eh? Ahh well don&#8217;t really matter as those who are friends know me for who i am anyway not some loud/wild person??? Unless anyone can disagree with that??? All I will say is weird, I wonder who&#8217;s watching me???

Anyway this weekend is hectic, dinner tomorrow, 4WD-ing on Sat + Shrek at night, dunno whats happening Sunday yet&#8230; Next week hopefully I can drive my mum&#8217;s car all week&#8230; maybe for the next month&#8230; lol if I work out how to park it&#8230; mmm but then who will drive mine and make sure it doesnt die or whatever it is (or same vice versa?)&#8230;

Blah I think it is time to go to sleep as I havw to unit mind tomorrow till the kitchen fixer dude comes then I might go to work and do some stuff&#8230;
