Bills, bills and more bills reads the life of the average uni student. The cost of living and cost of education has increased over the years with inflation and the average full time uni student works around 10 &#8211; 15 hours a week to earn enough money to survive (i.e. eat, buy textbooks, pay bills, fees etc). It&#8217;s kind of ironic really. We supposedly go to uni to get a better education, and yet many of us are working more hours then we go to uni for to fund that better education.
