Well yep I did go on that overnight expedition, which was cool/fun and everything else. The weather miraculously held up reasonably well though our initial plans did get changed after a random bush bash resulted in kind of getting stuck due to the lack of a reasonable route down and the weather clouds rolling in. All in all a good long weekend.

Oh and in today&#8217;s happenings, I finally bought a tv table/stand. One coffee table and piano chair later, I actually have real furniture. Now apparently (not my idea), the next plan is to somehow change my other furniture so I can get a table of some sorts back in&#8230; Anyone who&#8217;s seen my room will know how much available floorspace/wallspace I have left, so it&#8217;s a rather big call.
