Wow&#8230; very, very weird. I just had a phone interview for a job I thought I didn&#8217;t submit the application for. In fact I&#8217;m 100% sure I did not submit the application because I reached a question where I had to select an answer, yet none of the answers were relevant to me&#8230; Was not expecting it as I did not think I had the appropriate experience. Actually I don&#8217;t even know if I submitted my resume. Either that or I&#8217;m really ditzy?

My head is spinning&#8230; one interesting morning, especially because I thought it was another phone call I&#8217;m waiting for&#8230; Anyway should get back to the study, Project Management and Quality Assurance exam is tomorrow.
