Ahh well IT camp was okay. Though I think camping in tents would have been better, both for &#8216;fun&#8217; and also it probably would&#8217;ve kept out the cruddy insects and bull ants better. I got my timetable as well. At first I had a pretty crap timetable. Well not that bad, lots of half days, but on Thursday I had only 1 one hour tutorial smack bang in the middle of the day. If I&#8217;d kept it like that I&#8217;d have to work half days or nick out for two hours in the middle on Thursday. So yeah I asked to move my tutorial and all is now cool. Then since been back worked Thursday and Friday which &#8217;twas cool. I finished of some stuff earlier this morning so now I&#8217;m just lounging around, ready have my mid morning nap (LOL!). I might get out my mySQL book and dabble in some php and database stuff after this. In other interesting news got a $ increase which is pretty cool&#8230; I probably would&#8217;ve happily worked at the previous amount for as long as whenever, as it&#8217;s cool. But I&#8217;ll need to save. damn uni books&#8230;. Outta just two subjects its gonna cost $200+! and theres still another 2 subjects on top. But yeah I think I&#8217;m gonna go play with my computer now.
