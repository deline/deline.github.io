Argh so Federer didn&#8217;t win the other day but Hewitt won his match. Missing the final womens today &#8216;cos WaveAid is on today. Leaving in about 20 minutes to do a food and water run at Coles then heading to Central to meet friends then on to the SCG. I think after Sunday I&#8217;ll have to start learning how to watch the cricket!&#8230; Summer of nothingness has got me hooked on watching tv/sport etc.

In other news (not really)&#8230; I actually woke up to go exercising/walking this morning&#8230; got to go WaveAid roundup maybe late tonight or tomorrow&#8230; looks like its going to rain
