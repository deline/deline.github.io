If you&#8217;re ever out and about and you feel that urge to go to the toliet, rest assured. The [National Public Toliet Map](http://www.toiletmap.gov.au/) is there to save you. You can even use the [Trip Planner](http://www.toiletmap.gov.au/plan.aspx) to &#8216;identify toliet stops for a journey&#8217;. One wonders how long it will take before someone decides to do a roadtrip around Australia taking in the sights of our national toliets??? Though according to [this article](http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,18831147-13762,00.html), the site does sound pretty popular with 1000 hits a day&#8230;
