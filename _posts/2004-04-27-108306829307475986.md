My big toe is feeling demented, like it needs to be cracked or something, which I cannot do.

Have I mentioned how I don&#8217;t really like RE??? Grr and its due next week. Ahh in a more musical note, listened to Nirvana&#8217;s Nevermind cd the other day. Mmm pretty good, not quite what I preassumed. Haha though some of you woul be like &#8216;how can you have never listened to Nirvana&#8230;&#8217; eh well. That&#8217;s just the same as me saying &#8216;how have you not listened to &#8230;&#8217;
