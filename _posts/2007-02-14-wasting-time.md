So I have a crapload of time to waste today. My flight doesn&#8217;t leave till 6:30pm ish and I still have hours before I even have to consider about getting to the airport. And &#8216;cos I left my guesthouse at like 10am and have my pack with me I can&#8217;t be bothered doing all that much. Not to mention it&#8217;s hot and humid outside. So here I sit surfing/typing/wasting time/catching up on the news.

Oh random side topic, someone mentioned this to me maybe about a week ago, but they were saying how in Vietnam theres places where they&#8217;ll load your mp3 player with music/video content (as opposed to buying the cds/dvds &#8211; which aren&#8217;t all that legit anyway). So I had found one yesterday, and went through looking through the whole booklet to write down what I wanted and eventually had a list. Except then when I went to give it in, it was like it&#8217;d be ready at 9pm, but I wasn&#8217;t going to be down there then. Then I&#8217;m like can I come by tomorrow, and the guy&#8217;s sure, but then I was meant to leave my iPod with him, and there was no way in hell I was going to do that. I&#8217;m sure it would&#8217;ve been cool and all, but I wasn&#8217;t willing to part with my device. So I said I&#8217;d swing by today. Except I didn&#8217;t cos I can&#8217;t be bothered walking 15mins down then back up. Lazy I know, but no major loss.
