Christmas Day and I&#8217;m sitting in front of my computer&#8230; does that say anything about me?
  
Well now I&#8217;m deciding between Lego and a laptop&#8230; I&#8217;m really thrown on what to get. Both are educationally inclined in a way. Lego for creativity and programming aspects, a a lappy well because my education/future is going to be based around computers. A lappy would be cool, but I&#8217;m wondering how much I&#8217;d need to contribute to the &#8216;laptop fund&#8217;&#8230; (in my words). I think if/when I get one the budget is around $3, 700 &#8211; $3, 800 at max. But you can get heaps good stuff for that money these days anyway. Looking at Compaq&#8217;s and Toshiba&#8217;s&#8230; I like how Toshiba has the SD slot and the three USB 2.0&#8217;s. But then again Lego is cool&#8230;. blah.. I don&#8217;t know. If I got a laptop I&#8217;d probably use it more than Lego, &#8216;cos it takes time to build cool robots and program them and all&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. Maybe I should get the laptop now&#8230; and get the Lego later down the track. But then again, I can keep on building new stuff with Lego and it will never seem the same&#8230; or depreceate as much either. On another though, if I get the laptop now, my parents are probably more willing to pay for more now than if I got it later in which case I&#8217;d have to pay almost half.
