And we were the 1 in indoor soccer today. Its definately more intense and crazy than touch football and normal soccer. There is no offside and the ball never goes out of play.

As we had no girl subs today our rest was to go as goalie which may just explain how we lost by so much. Anyways in my stint there i managed to cos a ball right to my head where my left eye is. And it hurt like crazy when it happened. Plus it was kicked by a guy. At least it didnt go in.
