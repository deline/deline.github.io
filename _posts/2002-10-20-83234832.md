HSC starts tomorrow. First up is English. I think I&#8217;m gonna die. But then again, after that means no more change, no more Harwood no more enjambment. On a different note our plans have changed again. Now it&#8217;s Singapore on the cards. Not too sure about that either. It&#8217;s better than hicksville for a week I s&#8217;pose, but I&#8217;d rather catch a train across Australia, cos that would be heaps fun. Seriously&#8230;. like just looking at the vastness of nothingness would be cool. I should go back to study now&#8230;&#8230;
