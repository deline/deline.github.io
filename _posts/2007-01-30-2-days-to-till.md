I&#8217;m leaving on a jet plane bound for yet another journey into Asia. With no definitive plans (but I do at least have a very rough idea)&#8230; it&#8217;s just me and my backpack, trusty guidebook, brick of a novel, camera and mp3 player for the next 2 and a half weeks. 2 and a half wholesome weeks where I can do absolutely everything or absolutely nothing (but most likely somewhere in between). I do know however that on my so far planned 3 and a half days in Phnom Penh that I&#8217;m going to head out to visit an orphanage. Arranged it kind of last minute (though that&#8217;s nothing really new when considering this whole trip), so I&#8217;ve got to give the guy a ring over the weekend to sort out how I&#8217;m going to get there. More on that later.
