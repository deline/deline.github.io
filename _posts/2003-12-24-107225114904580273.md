And I wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! Okay so I&#8217;m a couple of hours early, but it really doesn&#8217;t make no difference. Today is as good enough as tomorrow and for that matter any other day. Mmm its a bit different this year. Dad has gone away for a couple of days down the coast so it&#8217;s just me, bro and mum. And tomorrow we&#8217;ve gonna have lunch at Mama&#8217;s instead &#8216;cos she&#8217;s back at the nursing home now. Yeah different is a way I&#8217;d put it, though the usual was kindof mundane in its own way. Wanted to hit the beach on the 26th but apparently I&#8217;ve got some air hostess of a cousin who&#8217;s in town who I have to meet or something. Still hopefully I can meet them in the morning then nick of to the beach? This and next week is the beach week! Weather better be good&#8230;

Listening to Something Corporate&#8230; it feels kind of melancholy in here&#8230; the coolness of the air conditioning against the darkness of the room with its blinds closed to stop the sun, casting a glowing shadow inwards as I sit here, in front of the brightness of the screen typing away here&#8230;

_If you ran to the end of the earth, i would catch you and you would be safe
  
if you fell down a well, i would bring you a rope and take all of your pain
  
all the pain
  
all the pain
  
that you hide from me everyday_
