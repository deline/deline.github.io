And I feel as if I am looking at the world from the bottom of a well

Lonely

And the only way to beat it is to bat it down

Oh all the days

That I have run

I sought to lose that cloud that�s blacking out the sun

My train will come

Some one day soon

And when it comes I�ll ride it bound from night to noon

Excerpt from Looking At The World From The Bottom Of A Well &#8211; Mike Doughty
