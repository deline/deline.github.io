So there&#8217;s nothing much happening in my life this week. Though yesterday night Jess and her sis came round to see if I had work clothes to raid for an interview she has on Friday. Other than that this week has been a working week. Meh also seeing they moved the TLE sunrise show indoors there&#8217;s no point going early, &#8216;cos I ain&#8217;t gonna cram onto some small balcony&#8230;

Gotta run, The Amazing Race is on in 4 minutes&#8230; go the nerds! (couldn&#8217;t resist saying that)
