Yes indeed I am @ deline neo . com&#8230;

Bah databases is a pain in the arse, it should be okay to do, but the damn reading is killing me for the assignment. DSPP is okay if I eventually fix it up so its nicer, RE&#8230; fsck that&#8217;s going to be aiming for a Credit this semester&#8230; IT Op&#8230; maybe we have hope. Mmm I wonder if I would&#8217;ve been better as a programmer? Probably would&#8217;ve but I don&#8217;t want to be. I guess that would draw the line between something being fun as like a past time, to being to full on. And I guess that&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been considering with a full time IT job&#8230; will it be to full on? I overheard part of a convo today, and was thinking to myself how funny that was, as that is kind of what I&#8217;ve been thinking about over the last years. I mean what is life and it&#8217;s meaning/purpose? Is their any point to working like a work whore if it drives yourself insane? I would say not. Otherwise there really is no purpose as it&#8217;s just a never ending vicious cycle of waking up in the morning to go to work to earn money to be able to live. Don&#8217;t want to see myself in that position&#8230; yet heading in IT is something where that is highly inevitable&#8230;
