Well today we had a little get together, us java-ers and a CCSS-er, well half us java-ers were CCSS-ers anyway. We went and saw &#8216;Bend It Like Beckham&#8217;. The movie was really good, and if you haven&#8217;t, I suggest you do. After that we had some lunch then went so some dodgy pub/bar in the city to play some pool. It had to be dodgy &#8216;cos most of us aren&#8217;t 18 yet, so we had to go to a place they didn&#8217;t check ID. We we&#8217;re gonna go to the UTS bar, but it was all closed. And I must say, I&#8217;m really shit at pool&#8230;.. it makes my elbow feel demented and uncomfortable for some strange reason or another. But yeah, the day was good I guess it&#8217;s the only day I&#8217;ve semi relaxed in a very long time.
