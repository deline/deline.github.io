Woah the whole Blogger website and blogging interface has changed&#8230; It looks a lot more modern, but I quite prefer the previous incarnation of it. I think this is the third overhaul they&#8217;ve had since I began blogging? (can&#8217;t recall).

Well guess what??? Today was like the first time I&#8217;ve actually truly had to ask for help in a lab because I was well and truly lost. But it all makes sense now, so that&#8217;s good. I could&#8217;ve fudged part of it and actually get it to submit and get my marks, but I&#8217;m not exactly into that. Kinda what to know they &#8216;why&#8217; to a situation&#8230; otherwise what&#8217;s the point as I haven&#8217;t learnt anything&#8230;

Mmm anyways yeah I only got onto my comp a bit ago, &#8216;cos got home from uni round 8:30pm ate some dinner, watched some TV, had a shower, yeah usual stuff&#8230; blah I&#8217;m going to head to sleep&#8230; got a new assignment, so I&#8217;ve just done a bit, but I need to write down what my brain is thinking before it goes into overdrive.
