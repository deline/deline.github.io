Here&#8217;s the latest from my microwave cooking adventures (this one did require the use of a grill at one point though).

Ingredients:

  * Eggplant cut into slices. For a traditional mini pizza look, cut the eggplant horizontally.
  * Cheese
  * Tomato paste or tomato based pasta sauce
  * Any other ingredients/toppings you&#8217;d like to add

Instructions:

  1. Precook the eggplant slices in the microwave on a flat plate. 2 minutes is a good time.
  2. Take the precooked eggplant slices out and grill them so that they are slightly toasty on both surfaces. This shouldn&#8217;t take long as the eggplant is already cooked.
  3. Once the eggplant is toasted spread a layer of tomato paste onto the top of each add the cheese and any other toppings you&#8217;d like.
  4. Stick it back under the griller to melt the cheese
  5. Eat!

Picture: This is just a tomato and cheese version. You could make your mini eggplant pizzas look and taste a lot better with additional toppings. How about some herbs or a light coating of olive oil? For meat eaters, maybe a bit of ham here and there. Don&#8217;t let the looks deceive you&#8230; it actually wasn&#8217;t too bad.
