I was waiting for this moment&#8230; and I didn&#8217;t think it&#8217;d happen so unexpected/quickly. I want to go home and lie in bed in the dark. I feel like lying in a corner and just dying. There&#8217;s that cold tingle through me and I feel like theres no meaning in life at the moment. It&#8217;s not so much a suprise now as it was before. But I still don&#8217;t know what to do. It&#8217;s times like this when I really want to just wish I was nothing, when I feel that I could and can just quit everything that is meanigful and good in my life. When I few worthless and see no light at the end of the tunnel. I want the weekend to be tomorrow but I have stupid uni. I want to do nothing. I wish that I could express my thoughts in words, rather than this typed banter that I&#8217;m posting. When you realise how big the world really is, you realise how little you are in the context of the whole world. What we do and say doesn&#8217;t mean anything, what happens around us is just a small speck of the whole universe. One person can&#8217;t change the world, and one person can&#8217;t save a few. Have you ever wondered if it was fate or destiny which determine our course of life? We&#8217;re all destined to part some time but when do we know it is the time? (if we are meant to know?)
