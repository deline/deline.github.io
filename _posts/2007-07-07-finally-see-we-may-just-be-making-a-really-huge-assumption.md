Some of you may know that I&#8217;ve often wondered if the whole &#8216;search for life extraterrestrial life&#8217; is flawed because we make the assumption that life is deemed to be based somewhat upon the one humans live and hence the requirements we have &#8211; e.g. water.

I just read an article then called [Life &#8211; not as we know it](http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/life--not-as-we-know-it/2007/07/07/1183351494657.html) and yeah it pretty sums up what I&#8217;ve wondered. Will be interesting to see if future expeditions and all that take this into consideration. The only issue with this all, is we can only base what we know on what we can see/experiment on earth &#8211; with the exception of space missions but their rather short anyway (not including the ISS). So the question bears how do we know what could be termed &#8216;life&#8217; on another planet if we can&#8217;t recreate/experience/see this on our own?
