Yep, sure thing. Had this team activity thingo today which was pretty much as the subject goes. Who would have thought making a origami cicada was so damn hard?!?

Then later after work, it was out to meet up with some of the grads for drinks. Was great to see the others who I hadn&#8217;t seen since orientation.
