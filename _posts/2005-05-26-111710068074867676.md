You know how a couple of months back I was talking about goals, dreams and achievements, and how most of them have come true/eventuated? I&#8217;m getting closer and closer to my final goal/dream. By final goal, I mean the one last major goal that has been in my five or so year plan that I kind of had in my mind around the start of Year 11 (2001). I don&#8217;t want to jinx myself or anything, but if such came true, I guess that would be a very, very cool moment on a multitude of levels. When I look back over the past few years, I would not have thought it possible to be where I am now in life, most certainly when I set my original aims/dreams/goals they seemed like just a distant blimp on the horizon, never to be met, but 4-5 years on they&#8217;re almost within reach. I don&#8217;t know how it is for others, but my words of wisdom is that dreams can/do come true. You just have to believe in yourself, and take every moment/opportunity as they come. Everything that happens happens for a reason, and if you learn from whatever event occurs, your part of the way there already. Stay true to yourself, and trust what your heart says&#8230;
