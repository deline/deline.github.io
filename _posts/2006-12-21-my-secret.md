Well i looked on the web to see if the bookstore even had it cos i couldn&#8217;t find it and it said they did. So rang them up and they had one copy. Picked it up after work and now am sitting here wasting time reading away.

I made a postcard once. I found it on my computer the other month. I think id be freaked to send it. Not that it is really anything exciting or momentous.

Maybe im just all dark and twisty inside.
