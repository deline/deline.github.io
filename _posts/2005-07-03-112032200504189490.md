[Make Poverty History](http://www.makepovertyhistory.org/). I&#8217;ve been following this for a couple of months now. There&#8217;s been been interesting debates from both parties about the effectiveness of such a campaign. Additionally there was the controversy about how one batch (or thereabouts) of the bands were actually made in a sweatshop. I&#8217;m still sitting on the fence. On one hand such a mass marketing of bands and the involvement of the world in the Live 8 concerts conveys a very powerful image, but on the other hand how many of those attending the concerts are attending them purely to see the bands? Though if anything I lean closer towards it as a positive step towards making poverty history. I guess we have to start somewhere, and giving the average joe and opportunity to be easily involved is clearly and easily one way to educate and spread the message.
