So after having two separate convos with friends on consecutive days regarding the &#8216;friending&#8217; of friends on Facebook and other similar social networking sites such as MySpace I was somewhat amused to read on the SMH website an [opinion article on Facebook](http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/a-poke-will-do-at-a-pinch-but-a-hug-from-a-friend-is-for-real/2007/06/10/1181414132402.html) which highlights the very questions somewhat raised by the convos I had. So much so that I had to post about the topic/article.

But some interesting points are raised. Social networking sites seem to lend a hand to adding friends who whilst one may class as friends may not necessarily be classed as &#8216;friends whom you would hang out with&#8217;. So in effect (and as the article points out) we are brought closer as our social network expands to include those we may not see on a regular basis yet further isolates us from opportunities of social networking in reality.

Even though I play on both sides of the &#8216;friending&#8217; debacle, the ultimate question when [Facebooking](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=facebooking) often comes down to:
  
_&#8216;To Add to Friends or not To Add to Friends?&#8217;_
