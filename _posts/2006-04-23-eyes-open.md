By the sounds on the [website](http://www.snowpatrol.com/) the new Snow Patrol album is going to be awesome. In ways it sounds a lot like Final Straw, but then at the same time there&#8217;s the more softer style of When It&#8217;s All Over We Still Have to Clear Up. Will make my day if they make a trip to Australia this year.
