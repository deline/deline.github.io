Some randomness, I was at dinner tonight at my cousin&#8217;s as it was her birthday, and we we&#8217;re talking about work etc, job hunting and so on &#8211; really just general convo stuff. Anyway it turns out that my convo group knew of quite a few people currently working at one of the companies I have applied for a position at. It was kind of weird, not in a strange way, but because it had a six degrees of separation feel to it all. Except this time the chain felt shorter&#8230;
