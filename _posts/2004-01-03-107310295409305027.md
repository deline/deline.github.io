Road tripped out to Krispy Kreme today. Went to Liverpool instead of Penrith, &#8216;cos it was closer (\*alot\*) and so better seeing I have a certain lack of air conditioning in my car.

On another note, I just spent the last few minutes looking at Maggot Therapy. Slightly gross, but actually quite ineteresting due to its potential. Do a search on Google to find some info about it if you feel like it.

Oh I bought a snorkel + mask yesterday, possibly going to test it out tomorrow. I haven&#8217;t bought flippers yet though&#8230; Argh spent so much money this last week &#8211; passport, snorkel, mask, and i gotta buy tix for RBF which means I need some money to buy merch!
