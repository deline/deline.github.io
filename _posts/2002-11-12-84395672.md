Hmm taking a semi lunch break now. Finished summarising Environments Through Time and am now about a quarter way through Caring For The Country.

Well today soon after I hopped onto my computer, which was reasonably late for a change, I got an email from UTS saying that I&#8217;ve passed the first stage of the selection process and I&#8217;m now invited to the interview stage. So, that&#8217;s pretty ace, because I&#8217;ve had this specific course in mind for let&#8217;s say, a very long time. Hehe, now I have to go shopping for clothes for this and the other interview =)

Well I think I&#8217;m going to go get a drink of cordial now, and settle into this chair for an afternoon of further summarising Earth and Environmental Science&#8230; Ph, passing thought, next thing I need to save money up for after schoolies, is a new hard drive. The current one works fine, but I don&#8217;t like the idea of linux on a partion on this HDD and would much rather prefer it have it&#8217;s own drive, so going to have to save my $ for a few months.
