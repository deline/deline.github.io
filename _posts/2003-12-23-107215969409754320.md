Grrr the Big Day Out timetable is up, and dammit Muse are clashing with Jet. Bugger&#8230; but I think I \*have\* to see Muse&#8230; &#8216;cos there music is&#8230; I can&#8217;t describe it properly, maybe enchanting is the word? but not the exact word I am looking for.

I was reading this blog today and the blogger was talking about the state of the I.T. industry in terms of outsourcing. Was interesting, as I have thought about these issues this last year and a bit, because it&#8217;s something that will affect me in the future. Though I guess I do have a backup plan up my sleeve which I would be quite happy/content with too, so I guess thats a comforting thought.

Mmm at the moment I&#8217;m stuck with coding something in Java. Been using JTable for the first time and I&#8217;ve skimmed the docos only briefly&#8230; but now I somehow need to update the model when the user enters/changes the data in a/the cells and am having probs doing so. The docos are confusing, and my brain ain&#8217;t functioning so maybe I&#8217;ll have another attempt later. Mmm though I probably should&#8217;ve done this in ASP.NET or something I guess, but I don&#8217;t think my version of IIS supports ASP.NET which I s&#8217;pose is a reason not to do so, plus I haven&#8217;t looked at .NET on my life!

Stockholm Syndrome by Muse rocks!
