Can&#8217;t resist &#8211; Hello Megan&#8230;.. lol im back to provide more blog reading. Anyway&#8217;s if you read this, you heading to homebake this yr??? Emily&#8217;s going too (I think). Also do you ride your bike? Should do Cycle Sydney around end of Nov. It&#8217;s 50KM or something form North Syd to Parra.

Hmm maybe I should&#8217;ve just used email???

Oh, whilst I&#8217;ve got my blog back&#8230; that stuff happening over in Russia is pretty crazy/sad stuff. Especially if you involve people who are incapable of looking after themselves let alone fending for themself. Low if you ask me. What&#8217;s the world turning to?
