excerpt: |
  So today we hiked/walked out to Cat Cat Village and back. But first, in the morning I had breakfast at a bakery next door. I was facing the window/road and it was quite amusing to watch the hill tribe women/girls run down the road following an arriving minibus, ready to pounce on unsuspecting (or suspecting?) tourists.
  
  The hill tribe women speak the best English you will hear in Vietnam and are great at talking to tourists etc but they are illiterate. So often when bargaining with them rather than punching numbers out in a calculator you have to play around with real money instead to show how much you will pay and vice versa.
  
  That said I did engage a few of them today though looking for things to buy. Though if you buy from one be prepared for a hoard to suddenly appear in front of you asking you to 'you buy from me...'.
  
  Back to walking though... did a walk to Cat Cat which is the nearest village you can walk from Sapa. Took a few hours but we made it back all good. Though I'll admit that some of the local women in flip flops overtook me and made it back up first!
  
  Sunrise from our room - just roll out of bed, grab a camera and you're set!
