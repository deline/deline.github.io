[Hi-frequency noises being used as ringtones](http://www.smh.com.au/news/web/this-is-one-ringtone-youve-gotta-hear/2006/06/13/1149964527427.html)? Looks like it. Eek&#8230; I&#8217;m over 20 (okay only by a bit, but still&#8230;) and after a few good rock concerts and a daily dose of my mp3 player I can still hear that noise perfectly fine. I&#8217;m certainley sure there are a great deal of adults out there who can hear that&#8230;

Still interesting idea nonetheless.
