_Sky is blue grass is green this is the most perfect day&#8230;&#8230;._ Hmm the weather is pretty cool outside&#8230;.. I can&#8217;t wait till our little trip. It&#8217;s going to be mad fun. Hmm so I might get a little uneasy with so many people, but it&#8217;ll be fun to like go to the beach every day and do whatever I feel like doing. But I&#8217;ll come back with not much $$$ probably. Hmm my mum said today if I do reasonably well I get to have my room done over. Well I&#8217;m getting a loft bed anyway so that I can put a study table under it and anpther bookshelf&#8230;.. and I&#8217;m gonna get rid of the dresser cos I don&#8217;t use it&#8230;.. and get a long mirror on the back of my cupboard door. I saw this mad office table at Freedom today&#8230;.. it was like metal and glass&#8230;. very sweet and expensive. Hmm well good to dream about I s&#8217;pose.
