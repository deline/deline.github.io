Oh yeah something I forgot to post about. In some ways I don&#8217;t think uni is any different to high school. In many ways, everything I hated about highschool, and battled demons with I still see/find at uni. Maybe it&#8217;s just the city uni&#8217;s, maybe it&#8217;s just mine. But as some had said to me in the attempt to brighten my life, I think I may have had the slight misconception to hope so. AS after 2 and a half years, I cannot say it holds true. I wonder if that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s like the the real world? I wonder how it&#8217;ll make me feel&#8230; I wonder how much it will continue to play apart of my life?

Ironically for one of my subjects we have to do these tests, and unfortunatley (or fortunatley), I&#8217;m fairly self aware of myself having deeply thought about stuff over the years. And it&#8217;s times like above that my awareness starts to get the better of me and make me feel not all that great.
