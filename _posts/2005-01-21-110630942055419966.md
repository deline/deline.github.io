Ah well the week has gone and I&#8217;ve done not much. Well read, slept as well as done some work during the week, though spread out. So whats happened. Nothing much, my brother found a job/apprenticeship so that was good. Kinda funny in a way because in the end amongst all his friends there will be enough tradespeople to cover every possible job! Hmm this Sunday heading to city to see some George/Thirsty Merc concert thingo at the Opera House forecourt. It&#8217;s this free thing by Amercian Express because of the Aus Open but you actually need to acquire tickets to get in. One of my friends Justin got a fair few of them so yep. Also I&#8217;m on a weird UK music phase at the moment&#8230; Snow Patrol, Badly Drawn Boy, the Manics, Stereophonics etc&#8230; the list goes on
