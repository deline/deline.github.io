Hmm a bit of argh and a bit of yay. So I waited till this morning to try and get tickets for Coldplay from Showbiz, but they only had Silver tickets for sale. But&#8230; we could register for a second concert (if one goes ahead), and the guy said we would definatley get GA tickets then. So I registered. So now I have to hope that a second concert gets annouced because I don&#8217;t want to end up with two tickets to the same show. Meh and it cost me like $30 extra, but if it beats waiting at Wynyard from 7am on Monday morning, I suppose that is better.
