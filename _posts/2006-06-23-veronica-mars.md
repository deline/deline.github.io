So Veronica Mars has started up again, but seriously, the timeslot is shit&#8230; Friday night at 9.30pm, if Channel 10 want ratings I can&#8217;t exactly see it happening&#8230; either way&#8230; I&#8217;m blogging about it, because the theme song is We Used To Be Friends by The Dandy Warhols&#8230; anyways in the intro before the opening titles for tonight&#8217;s episode, it was awesome because Veronica was talking about a friend&#8230; and she goes &#8220;we used to be friends&#8230; a long time ago&#8221;, then it cuts to the titles and if you know the song (or show) it goes &#8220;a long time ago, we used to be friends&#8221;&#8230;. good scripting writing there&#8230;.

anyway that was an aimless post from me&#8230; but yeh that show is another one which plays good music&#8230;&#8230;.
