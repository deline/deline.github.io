Hmm I re-did the website for WebGen last night. I really like the intro screen where you have to click to enter, but I hate the main screen. Eh maybe I&#8217;ll work on it sometime later. Yesterday was a semi-relax afternoon/night. In the afternoon I mucked about on the comp for an hour or so, then later it was Software and Maths. It&#8217;s 7.01 right now&#8230; I have to get ready for school soon.
