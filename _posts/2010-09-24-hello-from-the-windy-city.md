excerpt: |
  Made it to Chicago, though the plane was delayed due to some maintenance issues. Caught the CTA train to downtown and managed to find the hotel all okay. Hotel room we got given is a lot swisher than expected. It's got like a separate lounge area with a sofa, coffee table and TV (so 2 TVs in total)! But the internet is a wired connection that is a little flaky, so I've managed to connect to some other AP - but I have to sit near the window.
  
  Tomorrow going to head out and check out the Lincoln Park zoo (it's free apparently) the Threadless store and a few other areas. Hopefully the public transport system isn't too chaotic.
