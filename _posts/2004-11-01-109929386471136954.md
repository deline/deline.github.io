[Apple &#8211; iPod Photo](http://www.apple.com/ipodphoto/) Wow they&#8217;ve really done it. Though its usefulness as just a slideshow viewer I&#8217;m not quite sure. If it had a card reader built in I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;d be more a hit &#8211; especially for travellers. Greater battery life too. Apple takes another hold of the market sharehold with another brillant idea.
