Argh so busy&#8230; 3 weeks approx or so left of semester&#8230; in 2 weeks assignments all due on consecutive days&#8230; Still having troubles deciding what to write for my middle (main) section of BPITS essay. Thats the bit I have left, but I gotta work out if I&#8217;m for or against yet.. then change my conclusion to match it&#8230; As long as I get 14&#8230; or was it 15? something like that

Oh yesterday marks for NED assignment 1 were put onto livenet&#8230; was quite suprised to see I got 5/5 and 10/10 for discussion and essay respectively&#8230;. weird&#8230; wonder how assignment 2 stage 1 went&#8230;

Someone buy me tickets to Big Day Out 2005&#8230; actually I&#8217;ll get around to it sometime soon&#8230; blah The Living End are playing Falls Festival&#8230; on NYE&#8230; it would be mad as if they were on the BDO lineup (which I highly doubt).
