Not related together in this case, but that&#8217;s the Friday highlight roundup. Message to self: drinking beer during work hours whilst not eating at same time is not good if you have to think afterwards&#8230;

Other than that I did make my way to the instore, and was it a crazily long queue or what?!? I got there like 4.45pm-ish and kinda made the back end of the line (there were a good few people after me though)&#8230; and let&#8217;s say this queue was a very slow moving queue. But eventually I got down there, met the dudes, got my cd signed so I&#8217;m happy. 9 years later and I finally make it to an instore&#8230; I&#8217;m going to have TLE overload these next few months. Next Friday @ Martin Place, and later in May @ the Hordern.
