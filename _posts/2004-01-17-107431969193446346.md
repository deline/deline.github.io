Today woke up, kinda sunny, contemplates going over to Clovelly, but wasn&#8217;t 100% sure of the weather so ditched that idea. Then spent a while contemplating over whether to go swim or not, and whether to go to Homebush or Ryde. Decided on Ryde. From 8am &#8211; 9am there was only supposed to be 1 lane available in the Competition Pool (i think, if I understand the table right) but there was 3, and thank god the pool was in normal mode and not 25 metre mode. Anyways, so I swam&#8230; and omg I swam 16 laps&#8230; okay so it&#8217;s not much for some, but considering I haven&#8217;t exactly exercises properly in ages and haven&#8217;t swum properly in ages either, it was kind of a feat for me. That&#8217;s 800 metres. I think I could&#8217;ve swum the extra 4 for the 1 KM, but then I probably would&#8217;ve really been reduced to jelly! Anyways that&#8217;s my news for the day&#8230;
