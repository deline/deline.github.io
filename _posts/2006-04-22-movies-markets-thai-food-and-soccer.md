Okay so that sums up probably the last 24 hours. I was going to stay in last night because I was tired, sore and sleepy, but then I somehow landed up going out to watch the movie [She&#8217;s The Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454945/). Then today went over to Glebe Markets for a wander, then to Newtown for cheap thai food. $6 got me this massive plate of Pad Thai, think double sized portions &#8211; it was really huge! Then some random window shopping before heading back this way to Bill Mitchell park to watch a friend of the friend I was with play soccer.
