Well the third and final Big Day Out annoucement is out&#8230; it&#8217;s a bit of a hmm&#8230; urmph from me. I actually haven&#8217;t \*heard\* much of the band&#8217;s on the lineup, so it will be interesting. Though I&#8217;m definatley gonna check Muse out when their on. I formatted my comp today &#8211; twice&#8230; the first time &#8216;cos I stuffed the tweak/hack thingo to get Windows XP Home to run IIS. But all is well now, so I&#8217;m cool.

Also, I bought a CD today. North by Something Corporate. It&#8217;s pretty good&#8230; for when I&#8217;m in an emo kinda mood. I like &#8211; the CD artwork though, stencil kinda stuff.

Not a long blog today&#8230; I have an idea for a programming project&#8230; I was going to use VB.Net but then realised I was missing an install cd &#8211; Windows Component Update&#8230; so unless I decided to do it in java or resort to jsp&#8230; I dunno. Let me think&#8230;&#8230;..
