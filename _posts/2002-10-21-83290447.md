Cicadas aren&#8217;t that bad&#8230; the paper was actually okay except for Section 3. I did shocking there. For a start it sounds like an essay which halfway changes form when I realise it&#8217;s actually meant to be a feature article! And I only covered three texts. But at least ONE related material means that you have to have at least one only. Doing more obviously would help in the conveyance of information, but one is fine. That&#8217;s IMHO of course.

Everything&#8217;s been pretty surreal like it hasn&#8217;t hit yet. I have no idea how I&#8217;m going to remember the rest of these quotes. Apparently  _Fraud doesn&#8217;t give vision_.
