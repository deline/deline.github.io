Basically been working on uni stuff since who knows when. It&#8217;s kinda like the usual situation you know&#8230; which kind of sucks. At least I&#8217;ve got DSP out of the way so I&#8217;m kind of relieved about that. Two more to go and a revising for tests. And yet deep down I know in the end I&#8217;m only getting a piece of cardboard. Normally it&#8217;s those who just want to get their degree who say that. Contrary to that, I&#8217;m actually at uni to learn and further my knowledge, but deep inside I know it&#8217;s a piece of cardboard in the end. What I mean is, most of the stuff you know you learn yourself, and that&#8217;s they key difference as one would say in how well one goes. And it sounds dumb to say this, but alot of what I&#8217;ve learnt in 2000 &#8211; 2002 is kinda what we learnt in uni as well. Don&#8217;t get me wrong though, the stuff at uni was cool/fun becuase I&#8217;d already had a pre-interest in it, but it still leaves that void of space where learning is yearned.
