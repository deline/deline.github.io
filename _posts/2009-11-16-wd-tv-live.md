excerpt: |
  Got myself the <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/Products.asp?DriveID=735">WD TV Live HD Media Player</a> on the weekend after hunting through many a JB Hi-Fi and Dick Smith store with no luck. From my quick play around with it I'm quite impressed. Haven't set it up in my room yet though as I need to rearrange my power cables.
  
  I got the device primarily to connect my Mac to my TV, as since I've had the Mac I haven't been able to output to my TV as I don't own the correct cables. Whilst the WD TV Live probably does cost a bit more than just getting cables it is a pretty nifty device as it supports lots of audio and video formats and has a network port so you can access network shares as well.
  
  Might do a more detailed review of the setup once I have it all configured properly... which quite possibly could be next year seeing I'm leaving on a jet plane in 11 days...
