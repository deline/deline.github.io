So the [Akismet](http://akismet.com/) plugin has been included with WordPress builds for quite a while now, I never had it enabled because you need an API key which required a [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/) account. But finally due to the annoyance of having to delete comment spam every few weeks, I caved and got a key.Â  And so far so good, it&#8217;s managed to trap all the spam comments. What&#8217;s cool about this is that they auto delete after 15 days, so if I don&#8217;t check I don&#8217;t have to worry about a list in the 100&#8217;s long. Of course the downfall is if I do get a real comment which happens to get caught I need to flag it for de-spamming in time.
