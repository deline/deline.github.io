Eeek I just took my first dose of oral cholera vaccine&#8230; and it tasted feral. Though I think it was the bicarb granules which gave it the weird taste. Next dose in 2 or so weeks, along with my other vaccination. Meh half my luggage will be filled with malaria tablets and the like as opposed to clothes!
