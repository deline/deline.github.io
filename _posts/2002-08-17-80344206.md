I watched Lord Of The Rings last night&#8230;. its so so so so long&#8230; and I fell asleep midway for like 10 minutes&#8230;.. maybe I&#8217;ll watch Toy Story later. The benefits of having a computer with DVD player are heaps good. I can sit in bed nice and warm whilst watching movies.
  
Today I went out for a bit and bought a Frontline video for english and picked up my IPT book. Theres this other book I might buy next week or so. But I better sign off&#8230; I&#8217;m wasting valuable time here instead of working on my assessment.. make that assessments. Of which I&#8217;ve given myself like 1000 times more work with my choice of IPT project1 Way to much documentation.. oh well I liked coding the scripts to access the database so that was good fun&#8230;.
