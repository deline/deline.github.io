Got the next 2 days off, so I&#8217;m catching up with some buddies tomorrow. First we&#8217;re gonna go Sydney Uni as one of us have to enrol, then we&#8217;re going to hang in the city and do something, well we don&#8217;t know yet what we&#8217;re going to do. Ahh things are so sudden, on the weekend I found out that one of my friends is going to be moving away to Coffs Harbour in a couple of weeks to go to uni. It was kinda a surprise/shock. Anyway before it gets dark I need to go for my walk&#8230;. bye!
