Woot I just got cd priced $29.99 for $2.99. Looks like someone at JB Hi-Fi entered the price wrong for Snow Patrol&#8217;s When it&#8217;s all over we still have to clear up album. Also got Know Your Enemy by the Manic Street Preachers. The store at Maq howver isn&#8217;t as good as the one in the city which is like 100 times better. This store (the maq one), didn&#8217;t have the Snow Patrol DVD nor any Manics DVDs so meh. Oh well still good. Mmm and they stock Sennheiser headphones too. Lol tried to talk my dad in buying a pair of the PX200 then trading them with my HD497&#8217;s, &#8216;cos I wouldn&#8217;t mind the PX series now&#8230; the specs for them are better anyway, but the 497s are nice and comfy.

Other than that does anyone agree that trying to manage drawing/laying out a PERT diagram is impossibily difficult???
