Firstly, wow I&#8217;ve got another 3 more gmail invites&#8230; should I a) send them to people, or b) create accounts with really popular names then hope someone wan&#8217;s to buy them??? (is that evil???)

Oh and I added a tracker now&#8230; nothing major, just rather bored at quarter to 11 at night from studying all day, minus my 3 hour sleep in the afternoon &#8216;cos I was tired as&#8230;

if you wanna gmail addy, give me a yell
