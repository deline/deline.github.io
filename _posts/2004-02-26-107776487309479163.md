Please hope I didn&#8217;t f up, because I think I might have?!? I really hope I didn&#8217;t as I really want the job. I guess I&#8217;ll have to wait and see. After it I can&#8217;t remember if whether or not whilst explaining I made eye contact? Please hope I did. I am :-S at the moment. All other jobs I&#8217;ve worked I&#8217;ve kind of gotten them without an interview&#8230; lucky I s&#8217;pose. But it isn&#8217;t always gonna be like that. Cross my fingers and hope for the best xxxxxX Xxxxxx
