My \*very\* short story [readable here.](../notes/english/short_story.doc) A semi reflective piece in some aspects. Pretty crap hey? but I didn&#8217;t know what else to write about and I felt like writing something to express crap&#8230;. yes, words I can&#8217;t say aloud. There are times that you feel like falling back down, back into a deep dark hole. Maybe in times on uncertainty, I&#8217;ve never worked it out. Some things science just can&#8217;t explain. Well everything is only a hypothesis anyway so nothings definite. Maybe I should go to sleep now? sleepy ZzZZZzzzZ eyelids falling down like lead&#8230;. time to brush teeth, take drink and pull the blankets over my head in the darkness of night&#8230;like a animal hiding in its shell, all nice and warm and comfortable.
