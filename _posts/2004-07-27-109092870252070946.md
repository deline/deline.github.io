I so should not have crawled under tables at work today. I think I&#8217;ve like rebrusied the brusied knee and it actually hurts now when I move it and bend it and feels funny when I touch it. But other than that its good to be back home. Not that the snow wasn&#8217;t good &#8211; it was great &#8211; but part of me can&#8217;t really part with I think the city and the routine that is known as my life.

Crapsie Muse tickets got sold out&#8230; they weren&#8217;t yesterday. Though I wasn&#8217;t going to do I think because I know I have uni that night. Me hopes they have a second show on a night I&#8217;m free.

Anyways I&#8217;m off to sleep or read or whatever&#8230; work again tomorrows, then uni starts again ðŸ˜®
