Well last night (or should I say early this morning) I woke up to watch some of the olympics :-O Was up from around 2:30am to 4:15am approx. 4 x 100m relay was worth it. Close close race, and fast two unlike the 400m mens race. Then headed back to sleep. Then this morning, Went for a bike ride around mid-morning after doing some uni work first. Freezing cold. Riding against the wind across the bridge was harder than usual. Then had some lunch and headed down to the park to watch my friends grand final soccer game. My bro came down as well. Now I&#8217;m back here and I better read and plan for my assessment on Wednesday.
