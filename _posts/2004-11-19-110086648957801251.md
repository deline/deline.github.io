This week has been a crazy week for me and all really. Well as from previous stuff this week was exam week. Anyways how my grandma was sick and got sicker over the last few weeks. Anyways she kind of passed away on Wednesday. It wasn&#8217;t a suprise or anything, which in a way was good as it made things easier as we were prepared. But it was a crazy week because of everything else combined. We had the funeral today because my brother was going away tomorrow, and we had to somehow slot it in between my and my cousins exams. We cbf filing for misadventure because its some lame burecratic process (well for me it is anyway, and I don&#8217;t want to get assessed). But yeah the last 2 days have been a mad rush to get things organised, exams to sit etc. Haven&#8217;t had a real meal in a few days &#8211; rockmelon and ice cream is good&#8230;
