I just watched the movie In Good Company. When I saw the previews I was like&#8230;. hmmm&#8230; its a different kind of movie. Not everyone will like it. I found quite good to watch though. In respects it&#8217;s very About A Boy like style I thought, which I liked to. Then again one of the Weitz brothers worked on this one as well so maybe that&#8217;s where the similarity is&#8230;
