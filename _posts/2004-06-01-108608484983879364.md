Well got an assignment back today it was a pair assignment. I&#8217;m happy with the mark but I don&#8217;t necessarily think we deserved it. I didn&#8217;t think it was a that great piece of writing/report. I guess we did start ours very early, and I&#8217;m pretty pedantic with things, but either marking was easy, or everyone else was really bad, which I think the latter is highly unlikely, so it must&#8217;ve been the former. Would&#8217;ve liked more feedback, so I&#8217;ll bring it an ask on Friday&#8230; would like to keep a similar standard on the next if possible.
