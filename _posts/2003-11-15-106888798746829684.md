Here is the latest incarnation. A bright white with shades of teal, light blue and light gray. Hopefully it&#8217;s pleasing to the eye. Oh yeah I&#8217;m now accessible from www.delineneo.com.

In other news&#8230; OOD sucked&#8230; majorly. I have a bad feeling about it that I will need to sit the supplementry. It&#8217;s not so much I didn&#8217;t know my stuff, but more the questions were ambigious and hard to decipher what was actually being asked.

Anyway that aside I should start preparing for ICS now. Laters&#8230;
