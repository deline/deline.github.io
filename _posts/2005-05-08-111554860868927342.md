I was reading this article today (I can&#8217;t find an online version of it), about how Coldplay could very well become the &#8216;rock superstars of the 21st century&#8217;, and that &#8216;when it comes to truly universal rock music; British bands are still in a league of their own, superior to their American counterparts in every respect&#8217; (SMH 8/5/05). And I have to say that I agree, though I&#8217;ll say that it&#8217;s not just British bands, but UK bands in general. And it&#8217;s not just the well known bands like Coldplay, Oasis, Radiohead and U2 who form the leaguge, their are dozens if not many other bands, who compared to American counterparts bring so much more to the musical experience take for example Muse, Manic Street Preachers, Snow Patrol, Stereophonics&#8230; the list goes on. If you haven&#8217;t yet heard of any of these bands, I strongly suggest a listen.
