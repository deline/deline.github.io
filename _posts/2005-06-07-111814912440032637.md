<pre><pre>Ok there are a lot of Lost fans here that have already finished watching
Season 1 and are looking for something to give them a hint as to what might
happen in Season 2.

Try this:

go to <a href="http://www.oceanic-air.com/">www.oceanic-air.com</a>
at the bottom where it says "travellers" type in the numbers
4   8   15   16   23  42  and hit find (i have these numbers memorised after
watching so much lost.

Now click on the same numbers that apply to the seat numbers

this is the Lost season 2 teaser. In typical Lost fashion it doesn't really
resolve any questions or really let you know whats gonna happen in season 2
but its worth looking at.</pre>
