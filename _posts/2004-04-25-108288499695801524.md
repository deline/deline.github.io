Deline is tired, is sleepy, needs sleep. Needs to finish assignment and start studying. Needs to clean room of junket.

Mmm also after some googleing, am seriously considering looking for Industrial Training in Singapore. Seriously because it&#8217;s alot more possible considering I have dual citizenship, so no visa problems there. And seeing I&#8217;m female no N.S. problems there either. It seems like a reasonable idea, both for the experience &#8211; to get away for a year from Australia, and to get to know my relos over there, considering I haven&#8217;t met half of them. Plus would be interesting&#8230; Singaporean with aussie accent, who can&#8217;t speak a word of chinese! And its not \*too\* far from Aus either. But yeah that&#8217;s just one option. I&#8217;d have to work out how to renew my Singapore passport first&#8230; >.
