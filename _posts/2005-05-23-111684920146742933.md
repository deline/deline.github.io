Well, well as of late I&#8217;ve been back on the grad recruitment bandwagon, so lots of early morning starts to make interviews and all. Hopefully something will eventuate &#8211; well I wish and dream for it, but if it doesn&#8217;t happen, I&#8217;m pleased to have even had the opportunity to get this far. I guess I&#8217;ll find out in the coming weeks how things go. Other than that uni is picking up as well. Working up towards the final assessment/assignment week, and then into that stretch that is known as end semester exams.

After that&#8230; who knows&#8230; a month + holidays. Definatley some bike riding will get thrown into that schedule&#8230; still have to ride to Botany Bay (and back?!?)&#8230; maybe a short trip somewhere&#8230; any ideas? On a relatively short budget though.
