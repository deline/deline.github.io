I&#8217;ve been listening to music from my better days&#8230; like back 1999-2000 ish, though some songs are pre then which are still good.

ARGH!!! I&#8217;m waiting for the holidays to come round, because I&#8217;ll snap out of it then&#8230; hopefully. My mind is playing up again and getting the better of me and I&#8217;m scared. Not scared as in \*scared\* but just scared. Of what I don&#8217;t know. My fears? maybe but I doubt theres not too many there except for creepy crawly insects that is. But scared of becoming before, scared that one day I might actually do something stupid. That&#8217;s not to say I&#8217;m going to do something&#8230; but just knowing the feeling and thinking the thoughts is real enough for me even if they are a very remote possibility in a sea of options. It&#8217;s mind over matter. I just think&#8230; what if.

_Dreams are dreams and dreams must die, oh you took away what once was mine&#8230; Goodbye dad now, and goodbye mum, don&#8217;t follow me down, don&#8217;t rush into this&#8230;_

just some lyrics from a song&#8230; makes you think
