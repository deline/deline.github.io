I&#8217;m always so tired and it&#8217;s only just past 9pm. The weird thing is, I&#8217;m not even staying up late or waking up early. Well some may say 6am is early, but thats round normal for me, well between 6 and 6.30. I think my stress rash is coming back. Well that&#8217;s what I call it, &#8216;cos it&#8217;s the only explanation, to that itch on ym right elbow. Triangles give me lots of grief. Especially proving similar triangles! On a lighter note however, Maths isn&#8217;t so bad now. I&#8217;ve been doing like roughly 2 hours of Maths every day, and it&#8217;s quite good. Actually, I better go back to my Maths now&#8230;.. can&#8217;t slack off.hehe&#8230;
