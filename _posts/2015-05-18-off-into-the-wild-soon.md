There&#8217;s no denying I&#8217;m romanticised by the U.S. National Parks system (and Disney theme parks!). Every 18 months or so since 2008 we&#8217;ve made the trek over to see more of &#8220;America&#8217;s best idea&#8221; (with a Disney side trip).

I don&#8217;t really know what it is &#8211; fresh air, long hikes, bad internet, animals in the wild, dirt on my feet, impressive vistas, long drives, pokey towns, campgrounds.

Hopes for this trip:

  * See a moose in the wild
  * See killer whales
  * See Mount McKinley
  * Hike the Harding Icefield Trail
  * Hike part of the Wonderland Trail out to Summerland
  * Have a fire on the beach
  * Hike on a glacier
  * Hike Lassen Peak
  * Hike amongst Redwoods
  * See tidal pools on the Olympic Peninsula
  * Ride Radiator Springs Racer,  California Screamin&#8217;, Matterhorn Bobsleds, Indiana Jones Adventure
