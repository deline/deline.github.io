If it wasn&#8217;t the &#8216;lets not mention the company&#8217; to do with my internet the other week, I&#8217;m now finding foreign materials in lollies I&#8217;m eating. I&#8217;m walking across the Harbour Bridge and I feel this odd object (and taste) hit my teeth. At first I pass it off, then I spit it out to find out there&#8217;s bits of aluminium foil looking material all in it. And I turn to my friend and am like &#8216;there&#8217;s foil in this lollie&#8217;. So we then did some macro shots of the spat out foil riddled chewed up lollie whilst standing on the Harbour Bridge walkway.

When I got home out of curiosity&#8217;s sake I pulled the foil pieces out of the chewed up lollie and it looks like foil wrapping from either another type of lollie or something similar, there&#8217;s wording printed on the foil as well, but I can&#8217;t make out all of it as it&#8217;s only bits of foil. It actually turned out to be quite a bit once I had fished it out and unravelled the folded over bits. Looks like I&#8217;ll be spending more time on the phone in the complaints hotline.

And since it&#8217;s still tonight, I have to post of an awesome moment of sheer stupidity/funniness. It tooks us 3 ticket machines and a lot of attempts to buy a train ticket. I got mine fine, then we had problems trying to buy the next one. It was kind of one of those &#8216;user error&#8217; situations&#8230; but hey we&#8217;re not train people&#8230; so I think that cancels our really dumb attempts out.
