excerpt: |
  Very short post as I have 7 minutes of internet left (as expected, no free wifi access). Last day in Munich today, flying to Prague tomorrow. Quite a nice city, easy to walk around and lots of people ride their bikes everywhere. Is quite pretty as is fall right now and all the leaves have turned orange/red here whereas in the U.S. they hadn´t yet.
  
  May post once from Prague and Budapest otherwise will do a rundown post once home on Sunday week.
