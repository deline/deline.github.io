My news today, well on my way home I encountered the wanking flasher (in the literal sense). I contemplated whether I should bother to report it or not, but I decided I should, as it was near a school, a preschool and a children&#8217;s playground. This guy is what I would describe as a dirty/sleazy old man. Hell I even contemplated taking a photo for the sake of giving the cops evidence, but decided not to in case he tried to attack me or something. The weird thing was I had a feeling something was going to happen, so as soon as I saw the person behind the bushes, I locked the doors on my car&#8230; then the flasher appeared. Deciding that I would report it, I gave myself a few seconds to take in what I could remember then made my way to the cop shop.
