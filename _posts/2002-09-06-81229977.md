Um I stuffed up my SDD test today lilke majorly&#8230;.especially in the object oriented part! LOL&#8230;&#8230; um yeah I read the code in a &#8216;different light&#8217;, so thus answered the first 2 questions not properly&#8230;.. argh&#8230;. okay semi funny.. but still. Eh that was a weird way to show inheritance is all me says&#8230; hencce I thought _public Item_ meant the item was like &#8216;public&#8217; because the public word confuzzled me about the very nature of the code&#8230;&#8230; eh&#8230;. oh well.. thats something I learnt from today. And any thing learnt is something good.
