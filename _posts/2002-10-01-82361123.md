There is like 20 days to go! And I really really need to do something about the Change unit. If anything in English, it&#8217;s down the drain there. Well only for the essay hopefully. I need quotes dammit! I need to remember them! _The head humbler in black flapped, whirred with insect nervousness, a sage old fool, she sit&#8217;s in the park, a child one summers evening soaked&#8230;_ Argh&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. I can&#8217;t remember anything. Brain strain!

Ooh&#8230;.. I d/w all this abandonware today. And as soon as the HSC&#8217;s over I&#8217;m gonna play them like crazy. Remember Keen? Was he cool or what&#8230;.
