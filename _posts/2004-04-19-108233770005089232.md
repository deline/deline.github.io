Still in procrastination mood. Got all the info I need, now to just write it down into a report. I know what I want to write, but not quite how I want to phrase it (the hard part).

Anyways got bored of not knowing how to structure sentences properly, so headed out to visit grandma for an hour or so. She seemed pretty happy and alert today &#8211; even had a few interesting convos which was good.

What&#8217;s a good movie to see tomorrow night? Gotta get back to Em on whatever I&#8217;ve decided to do tomorrow night.. Maybe movies and a trek out to Harry&#8217;s for pies??? If I don&#8217;t get lost driving around at night in the city&#8230; hehe ahh probably just trek to a 7-11 to get frozen cokes.

Someone \*kick\* my brain so it wakes up!!!
