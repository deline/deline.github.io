Argh my life is revolving around fscking plants at the moment. And I wish I knew biology stuff. The science subject is actually pretty interesting, but whenever it refers to biological stuff like diploid, haploid and 2N, 1N and so on I am completely loss. I&#8217;m wondering whether its heavily linked with bio in which case I&#8217;m fucked really. Considering everyone else is also doing Cells, Genetics and Evolution&#8230; And I have to learn about all these plants, botanical name, common name, habit, foliage, flowers and fruit, landscape uses&#8230; 90 plants in total I have to remember/learn at least 30.
