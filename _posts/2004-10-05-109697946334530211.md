Hmm I wasn&#8217;t at uni today&#8230; www2.itd.uts.edu.au.. ah wells.

Anyways yeah booked properly our flights and accomodation today. $710 dollars down and about $1300 to go. Yay&#8230; I&#8217;m coming back on the 31st of December night flight, so I spent new years eve in the air and arrive back 7 something in the morning on new years day.. pretty groovy. It&#8217;s so not long to go, 8 weeks and 1 day I think. Dad leaves for Singapore in 3 weeks then he comes back a week later. Then Calvin goes to Schoolies a week or so later, then comes back, then I leave a week or so after he gets back.

I feel like a bludger &#8211; I&#8217;ve had a holiday like so frequently ever since I finished high school. After high school their Noosa trip. Call that Summer &#8217;02 (i wasn&#8217;t exactly summer yet, but it&#8217;ll do for reference). Then Summer &#8217;03-&#8217;04 was the Cruise to Noumea and New Caledonia. Then Winter &#8217;04 I had to take a week off &#8216;cos of a horrid exam timetable &#8211; all in one week consecutive days (so it wasn&#8217;t really a holiday as such). Then in Winter &#8217;04 there was the snow trip as well (though that was only 4 days I think?). Then Summer &#8217;04-&#8217;05 it&#8217;s Thailand/Singapore. Seeing a trend there??? I feel bad&#8230; lol&#8230; oh well I&#8217;ll get over it.
