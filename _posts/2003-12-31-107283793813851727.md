Have a Happy New Year everyone, and may 2004 be better than those gone by&#8230; okay so I&#8217;m a few hours early&#8230; but I&#8217;m gonna get a few hours sleep before I have to go out. Hopefully it&#8217;ll make up for my lack of sleep and I&#8217;ll still be able to wake up at 8-ish tomorrow to go to the beach and get free cheapo parking&#8230; anyways I&#8217;m off, time to fall asleep listening to music in the dark coolness of my room.. Laters! =)
