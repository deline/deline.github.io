Argh!!! I need (read: want) my passport back. I hand it in on the 24th of September for a visa, and I still haven&#8217;t got it back because they kept it for a bit before sending it out. It&#8217;s 2 weeks exactly before I leave, and the guy can&#8217;t even tell me if it&#8217;ll be back by next Saturday! This is the point where I swear for the obvious reasons. It&#8217;s made worse because I need it to sign some identity documents for the bank as well as to get Traveller&#8217;s Cheques which ironically enough require me to have my passport as proof&#8230;. Here&#8217;s to hoping/praying it comes back on Monday or Tuesday.
