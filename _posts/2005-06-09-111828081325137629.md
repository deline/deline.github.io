How good is the new Foo Fighters album [In Your Honor](http://www.hmv.com.au/product/rockpop.asp?sku=976023) going to be? I&#8217;ve had a listen to the couple of the tracks and they kick. So does the Oasis album [Don&#8217;t Believe The Truth](http://www.hmv.com.au/product/rockpop.asp?sku=976147).

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
   
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
   
Has someone taken your faith?
   
Its real, the pain you feel
   
You trust, you must
   
Confess
   
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
   
Oh&#8230;
