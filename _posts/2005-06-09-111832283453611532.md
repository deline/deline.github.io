OMFG Oasis really are coming to Aus&#8230;. I have been waiting for [this](http://www.oasisinet.com/site.php?site=news&idx=592). I heard the rumours. Tickets go on sale on the 20th of June&#8230; lucky my exam is in the afternoon, as I am so staking out Ticketek on Elizabeth Street! Thing is though, concert is on during the exam period&#8230; so I hope I don&#8217;t have an exam that night.. either way if I do, Oasis won&#8217;t be on till 9-ish so I&#8217;ll still get there. Though if they release a second concert, which is on the Sunday that would be sweet. I wonder who the support act will be&#8230; would love it if it was like Snow Patrol or Manic Street Preachers&#8230; though I doubt it&#8230;&#8230; This absolutley tops it, Stereophonics and now Oasis&#8230; what next.
