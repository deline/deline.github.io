So I just had a driving lesson&#8230; and even the instructor thought I should have no problems passing. So there the proof is&#8230; the RTA is rorted&#8230; well to some degree. When I did kerbside stop, he asked why I checked to my right&#8230; I told him &#8216;cos second time I got told that I had to and that was why I got crossed. He said I didn&#8217;t&#8230; PROOF.

So I decided I&#8217;d go with them for the test. Bloody hell it&#8217;s gonna cost me $145!!! >.
