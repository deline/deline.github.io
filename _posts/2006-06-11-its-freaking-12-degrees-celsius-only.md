With strong winds and rain and I&#8217;m dressed in like 4 layers of clothing, scarf and beanie for my trek (not really) to the city to watch [An Inconvenient Truth](http://www.climatecrisis.net/) which is showing as part of the [Sydney Film Festival](http://www.sydneyfilmfestival.org/). Semi tired as went out last night and didn&#8217;t sleep till 4am, came home 1.30pm today and leaving in about 45min&#8230;. speaking of last night I&#8217;ve got to blog about that, maybe later tonight&#8230; somehow we landed up at a place which was the location for an [online dating site&#8217;s](http://rsvp.com.au/) event night! Hell there was even a pimp and his mail order brides&#8230; (who ended up getting kicked out anyway)&#8230;
