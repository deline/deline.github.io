Meh every time I walk into JB Hi-Fi I walk out with CDs&#8230; bought the OST to About A Boy, because it&#8217;s actually an album by Badly Drawn Boy, well he wrote the soundtrack for the movie. Maybe I should save up stacks of money then go on a mega cd/dvd buying spree? There&#8217;s an idea&#8230;

Oook, almost forgot, got my Plant ID test back today&#8230; 93%, I&#8217;m really happy with it. I heard mostly everyone else just passed, or got somewhere between 65% &#8211; 80% ish. Here&#8217;s to hoping it goes as well for the other two&#8230;
