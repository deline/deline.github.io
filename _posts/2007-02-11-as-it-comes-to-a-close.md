Well not quite yet (have a week left), but I&#8217;m leaving for Singapore in 3 days. And that leg back is close enough to home for me&#8230; so what can I conclude?

  * Dust is good for your health (\*joking\*) &#8211; I think I understand why people wear face masks or wrap something around their face. Though silly me only resorted to doing so today! Plus it gives you a nice red-brown glow (along with all the clothes)
  * Pick the moto/tuk tuk driver who isn&#8217;t harrasing you
  * Fresh fruit is good
  * The Internet was a wonderful invention&#8230; so was the mp3 player
  * People in ancient times must&#8217;ve had legs of steel to climb the crapload of stairs there are up to wats and so on. Either that or I&#8217;m super weak (which is highly plausible).
  * After a few days you really can&#8217;t be bothered with ensuring your clothes are washed properly (e.g. I&#8217;ve been wearing the same boardies and 2 shirts since Tuesday). As long as they don&#8217;t smell it&#8217;s all good. It has gradually declined from using soap to wash the clothes to something along the lines of &#8216;what the heck, everyone else is going to smell as well&#8230;&#8217;
  * Hot weather makes you really sleepy

Other than that&#8230; I think I&#8217;m possibly getting a cold. Which sucks bigtime, so I&#8217;m drinking all this water and other stuff to try to get it to go away.

Anyways gotta go pack my stuff for my trip back up tomorrow.
