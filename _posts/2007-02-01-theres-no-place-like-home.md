The article titled [&#8216;Boomer parents give kids no reason to leave home&#8217;](http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/outgrowing-the-nest/2007/01/31/1169919402354.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1) is quite true. Whilst I can&#8217;t associate with some points 100%, for the most it is spot on. Food, laundry, cheaper board the list is actually quite long when it comes to the benefits of living at home. Take for example I&#8217;m off on my latest short sojourn into Asia and I had my two friends over for a barbecue tonight. Now I&#8217;m supposed to be cooking&#8230; but my trusty parents handled that for me (thanks dad it was good!).

When it talks about the trend across the developed world, I tend to agree. Personally I think that in the future, homes will be more like those in developing nations as well as Asia. With multiple generations of families living under the same roof (or in somewhat close proximity). The housing market and cost of lifestyle is continually increasing and additionally our lives are becoming more complex/time consuming. It some ways I can see how living in a bigger family/household could have it&#8217;s benefits&#8230; I doubt it&#8217;s the thing for me &#8216;cos you know too many people at once don&#8217;t work all that great with me&#8230; but it does have it&#8217;s valid reasons&#8230;

Anyways adios&#8230; next post will be the inaugural posting from Changi airport in Singapore. 3 hours or so to kill and free Internet at the airport&#8230; what more does a geek need? (only joking&#8230; :-p)
