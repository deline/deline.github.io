_I can&#8217;t read you, I don&#8217;t need you, everything is someone else&#8217;s problem&#8230;_

If only everything was someone elses problem.. would that mean we would have no problems because if you passed your problem on to another person, they had no problems too &#8216;cos their problem was really someone else&#8217;s problem too? Anyway my freaking ankle is still weird when I walk longer distances or try an run on it. Decided that if it doesn&#8217;t get better by next week then I will see someone about it. No point crying over spilt milk.
