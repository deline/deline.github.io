Why is the weather crap of late? On the days it&#8217;s actually sunny, it&#8217;s too hot to go to the beach because it&#8217;s 30+ degrees. Then on the days where the temperature is actually nice, it happens to be totally grey and overcast with occasional rain&#8230;

Other than that, yesterday was a shopping expedition day with Trish + Ang. Birkenhead, Lane Cove then over to Alexandria to the Seafolly store. Then spent the afternoon watching Fantastic 4, then back to my house for food and a massive watching session of Season 2 of GA&#8230;
