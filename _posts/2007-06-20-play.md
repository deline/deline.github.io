So yesterday night I went and saw (or really should be &#8216;heard&#8217;) [PLAY! A Video Game Symphony](http://www.play-symphony.com/) at the Opera House and it was super cool. Like nerdy music cool all in one&#8230; and there was Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog along with other cool tunes from video games. Except that all of today and even now, I&#8217;ve got the Super Mario theme in my head&#8230; which was such complete awesomeness in itself that you have to watch the YouTube version of when it was played in Stockholm.



And apart from that the other highlight would&#8217;ve been the freezing wind and rain trying to find a taxi at 10:30pm at night.
