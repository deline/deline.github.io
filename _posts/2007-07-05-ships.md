So if I&#8217;ve seen 2 big ships in less than a week does that count as slightly crazy? For which, the difference between a ship and a boat is that a ship can carry boats whereas a boat can&#8217;t carry a ship. Which kind of does make sense if you think about it. Anyways here are some pics from the ship expeditions:

Pasha Bulker &#8211; that ship that ran aground on Nobbys Beach in Newcastle:

USS Kitty Hawk &#8211; currently docked in Sydney:
