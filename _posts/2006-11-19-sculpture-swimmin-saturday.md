Headed over to Bondi yesterday for my inaugural visit to check out [Sculpture by the Sea](http://www.sculpturebythesea.com/) and a swim at Bondi Beach. My brother and I went which was somewhat surprising/new &#8216;cos we never do anything together&#8230; (suppose there&#8217;s always time for a first?).

Had a rather expensive (for me anyway) lunch which considering we didn&#8217;t get our stuff stolen meant we could pay for it. Oh step back, &#8216;cos like two groups of people sitting around/near us got stuff nicked. One guy lost a whole backpack with wallet, keys, camera pretty much everything. It would&#8217;ve sucked to be him, &#8216;cos I heard he didn&#8217;t own a spare set of car keys so would have to pay for someone to break into the car and make a copy of a key from the lock. Remind me next time to lock everything in the car.
