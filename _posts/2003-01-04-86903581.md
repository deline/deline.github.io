Bought some CD&#8217;s today. Had a $50 voucher from Christmas, and as there were no clothes I felt like buying in the City yesterday, today I went to Maquarie and bought some CD&#8217;s instead. Also bought one for my dad. They had 15% off, so it was good. Yeah I got the Big Day Out compilation CD and a 28 Days single&#8230; my dad got some 2 cd album thingo. So it was okay for $59, well I had to pay 85c extra, but its still reasonable&#8230; as the BDO and my dad&#8217;s one were meant to be $35 each and the single $5. SO yeah gotta go back to listening to them, or rather copying to my HDD, as I am too lazy to put the CDs in my computer each time (I moved all my standalone equipment out of my room so I&#8217;d have more room space).
