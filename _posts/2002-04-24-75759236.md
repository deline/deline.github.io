_Pump It Up_ by Elvis Costello rips big time. Yeah yeah I know its old, like back from the 70&#8217;s but it bloody kicks arse. Remember when Automatic did a cover of it for _Occasional Course Language_? Anyways I wish the holidays were over. As much as I dislike school most days, its at least something to do. Only prob will be, as soon as I get back, things will still be just as crappy&#8230; it&#8217;s that vicious circle of life working at it again.
