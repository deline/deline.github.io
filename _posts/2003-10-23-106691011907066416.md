Well DCA is out of the way now, so I can focus on my other assessments and the upcoming exams. Funny thing though is that Charlie decided to play up agian and chuck a hissy fit so now everyone has an extention till midday Tuesday. That&#8217;s like 5 whole extra days!!! But yeah I and a few others handed ours in anyway &#8211; plus our code will be looked at more lenently (or something like that) because we actually still managed to hand it in by the original due date. I hope I go reasonably well for it, because I actually quite liked the assessment/assignment task. Something I kind of felt at home with. Though the other day I realised using a vector would&#8217;ve been better! >.
