Hmm well today I spent the morning reading Networking 2 notes, then my aunt came round with her comp, so I could format/fix it up, so been doing that since 10 something-ish. This week has almost gone&#8230; and I&#8217;m glad to say its one of the rare times in the last year(s) or so where I haven&#8217;t begun feeling like shit. Maybe &#8216;cos its only one week eh? Next week will be a good week&#8230; I think. Sal&#8217;s coming down (if I&#8217;ve worked it out right???), and Thursday night will catch up with some ppls at MQ uni.

Do you ever get emails, and you don&#8217;t know if you should reply or not? Because their not like emails which &#8216;ask/need&#8217; a reply, but it may be ettiquite to do so? Just a passng though. Oh&#8230; listening to Pennywise&#8217;s cover of Stand By Me&#8230;.. _Why won&#8217;t you f$#^&*g stand by me_
