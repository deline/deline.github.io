Lol I&#8217;ve had an okay night surprisingly even thought it was some family sorta do thingo which I&#8217;m not usually a fan off. Why you say? Well there was this one little kid who was hilarious not in an eniterly funny way but he was just a cool kid. He was 4, and we walked in (me and my dad) and he follows us down the stairs, and goes &#8216;excuse me what&#8217;s your name?&#8217; and so we told him, then my dad goes &#8216;what&#8217;s your name, is it peter?&#8217; (peter being some random name)&#8230; anyways the kid (matthew) ended up thinking my dad was peter&#8230; you kinda had to be there. Haven&#8217;t met a 4 year old like that in a while. That kid will go places with a personality like that (though somehow I think the Pepsi sugar hit played a part).
