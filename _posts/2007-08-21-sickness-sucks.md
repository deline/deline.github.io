So my brother being super sick last week should have been foretelling in how I were to spend this week. Saturday is me &#8216;hmmm I think I might be getting sick but it could be my imagination&#8230;&#8217;. Lets skip to Tuesday and I stayed at home today &#8216;cos I was feeling slightly worse for wear, plus in the interest of public safety and what not it was probably better for me to stay at home. But it didn&#8217;t make me feel any better if not slightly worse&#8230; and it kind of sucks that I can&#8217;t taste anything I eat.
