As my rather hectic week of work drew to a close (as a result I now <3 Unix.... lol) , yesterday commenced with a brunch thingo at [The Westin](http://www.westin.com.au/s_res.html). Then after work I headed down to Jess&#8217;s worked bummed there for a bit then headed back my way to [Opera Bar](http://www.operabar.com.au). If you ever go to an outdoor bar on a cold winters night which happens to be right on the harbour&#8230;. remember to wear alot of clothes! >.< Unlike me with socks that left a gap when I sat down leaving my ankles freezing cold... Had a few drinks ate some chips for a bit then heading home to find out that the stupid internet wasn't working.... So I sat down and watched my dodgy (fuzzy) recording of Veronica Mars before rolling into bed.
