Fark I&#8217;m am so confused. Everytime I get one of these emails re intern program applications for next year, for a good moment I read the criteria and think &#8216;that sounds okay&#8217; and when I meet the criteria I feel like I \*should\* apply for it. And that I&#8217;d have a good chance. But then theres that niggling though which says no, you&#8217;ve 90% decided not to do it. Then the other though of &#8216;so what if you decided to stay in IT and cannont find a job when you graduate?&#8217; Theres some internships for Sun. It sounds good. Except you have to do it for a whole 12 months which is a long time for me. Maybe I should apply and see how it goes? But then if things turn out&#8230; I might end up taking a job (this is in general btw not just for this one)&#8230; then end up kicking myself 2 months down the track. I was talking to my dad last night about maybe doing some science subjects. I told him about cool jobs, but their not exactly the type of jobs you could do when your older he though. Reckons I should try honours if I have the marks instead of working (&#8216;cos I mentioned not working before). But honours&#8230; to me, that is almost the same as working, locked into this thing for a year.
