la la la la la &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;that doesn&#8217;t make much sense&#8230;.. well its supposed to be the Daria theme..or part thereof&#8230;. but the keyboard only types letters unforutnatley.
  
Had a squiz at some of the uni&#8217;s today&#8230;. UTS is cool&#8230; damn now i got to study more.
  
I&#8217;m bored.. or that should rather read procrastinating over what I don&#8217;t know. I looked at books today. Bought some study books for revision. Book stores must make stacks of money this time of year me thinks. Gotta stop using me thinks&#8230;. eek&#8230;. and that word too. I feel like filling up space so I&#8217;m going to type useless junk like this.. and this and this again too. Ooh..ahh&#8230;. blah&#8230;
  
Actually I installed PHP this morning&#8230; which is cool cos now I can play with PHP and MySQL&#8230;. MySQL I need to learn better&#8230;. hehe command line&#8230;..RDBMS the GUI client I got is crappy&#8230;.. well basically you have to use SQL statements for everything!
  
Rah&#8230;..la&#8230;. no&#8230; don&#8217;t end sentences in la&#8230;I feel like rhyming so now I must say that it is time to go &#8216;way to do some study with all work and no play.
  
Yay&#8230;. wtf did I write all this for&#8230;&#8230;.
