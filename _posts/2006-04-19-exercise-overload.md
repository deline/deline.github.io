I&#8217;ve gone from almost no exercise (well only one day a week), to almost every day. Tomorrow marks a 3 consecutive day stretch where I have worked those muscles. Joining a gym, then deciding to join a touch footy team as well might have been just a bit over enthusiastic&#8230; Especially since tomorrow I have informal touch training during lunch, followed by a gym trip in the afternoon&#8230;.
