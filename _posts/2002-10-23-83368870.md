English in about 2 hours and 20 minutes. I am not looking forward to it. Well I guess no one looks forward to exams. But on the contrary, once it&#8217;s finished, it&#8217;s finished which means I can forget it&#8230; till the results come out =)
  
I played some piano last might&#8230; I felt like doing it. It&#8217;s weird whenever I need to relax a bit when I have exams, I go and play the piano&#8230; I&#8217;m trying to play Army by Ben Folds Five. I can get the first bits&#8230; but their just chords so they weren&#8217;t that bad. I should go now and revise my quotes. _We&#8217;ll soon be home and high &#8211; dry and home &#8211; I&#8217;ll hie you &#8211; dry an &#8211; high and home. Over my step over my dead body!, It&#8217;s the abscene of presence, nothing more, It&#8217;s just a man failing to reappear, I burst into the moon, sun and stars of who I really am. Being Fish Lamb. Perfectly. Always. Everyplace Me. We&#8217;ve have all these little fish. We go after the little guys, ruin them but we don&#8217;t bag the big fish, We divide these guys, but we multiply the fridge repairmen!_
