I saw an owl last night. I was driving into my street when this thing swooped across my car. I wondered what it was, but it wasn&#8217;t a bat because it was greyish in colour (hard to tell at night) and had wings. It&#8217;s wingspan was pretty big. Then saw it fly back to the other side of the road and down to perch. Figured it was an owl &#8216;cos it looked like one. Anyways my brother said he&#8217;s seen one in our backyard before (at night of course). So went outside to have a quiz at the thing and it started flying between perching places. Pretty cool&#8230;
