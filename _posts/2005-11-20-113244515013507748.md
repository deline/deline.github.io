So did a beach trip yesterday afternoon which was heaps good. That&#8217;s the thing I&#8217;ll miss about being away this summer again as it&#8217;ll be two summers where I haven&#8217;t been able to hang at the beach etc as much, as by the time Jan/Feb comes round things start picking up again.

A random funny side story is on the way back I had to change shoes, so I stuck my water bottle on top of the car. Except I forgot about it. The strange thing is I managed to reverse up a driveway bump/kerb thingo, do a u-turn and turn around a corner before the bottle fell off which was kind of weird cos it stayed on for ages.

And other than that I&#8217;ve been ISODing it recently. Final exam on Tuesday and then that is it. The end. No more. It&#8217;s been a quick 3 years.
