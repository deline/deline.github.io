Being the computer geek that I am, I&#8217;m going to put a shameless plug for [The IT Crowd](http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/I/itcrowd/). It&#8217;s a new comedy television sitcom/show about you guessed right, the IT department in a company who have been relegated to the basement of the company offices. Really it&#8217;s a mockery of the stereotypical view of IT, but nonetheless some light hearted entertainment viewing.
