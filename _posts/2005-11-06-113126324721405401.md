So I went to [Sculpture by the Sea](http://www.sculpturebythesea.com/) today. It was also our opportunity to take the [Cross City Tunnel](http://crosscity.com.au/) for free. I&#8217;m a bit amazed at how empty the tunnel was considering it&#8217;s free till November 13th. There was like only 3 or 4 cars in it when we went through. But 80KM and hour driving is good, except when you pop out at the other end and land up in traffic.

But yes other than that 15 days to go, and madly catching up with Contemporary Enviro Issues content. I think I have a lot to cram&#8230;
