Yes, I&#8217;m on a mission&#8230; I&#8217;ve been on the mission since Sunday afternoon. So I go to the bookstore again, as they said it&#8217;d be in this week and the shipment hasn&#8217;t arrived yet. But the most annoying part, was they actually had a copy behind the counter, the counter person even picked it up&#8230; only problem&#8230; it was on hold. Oh well, I&#8217;ve placed an online order now, so when it&#8217;s in, I&#8217;ll get a nice little email and go for a walk down the road&#8230;

Other than that&#8230; they killed Tony!
