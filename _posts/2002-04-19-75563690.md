Today is a crap day, and it&#8217;ll probably be for the next few weeks too. Life sucks sometimes doesn&#8217;t it? Makes you wanna pack your bags and just keep on walking into the ether sometimes. My stomach is growling, I feel sick and there is not really any food in this house. No biscuits, no ham, just plain bread. Anyway starvation is half the key to something in this world, whatever that may mean who knows&#8230;
