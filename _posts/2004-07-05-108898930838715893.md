Okay so I had the strangest dream last night. It involved a penguin, a possum, an apple (which was a granny smith), a plate and a pot plant. The penguin was eating the apple then it called over the possum and was talking to the possum. It was asking the possum what the thing it was eating was. Mentioned it was nice and juicy but a bit to hard. Then I started trying to talk the possum and penguin, but they started walking towards the pot plant. Then my mum woke me up.

One crazy dream hey? Makes it sound as if I was on drugs or some thing like that&#8230; but the penguin was cute&#8230; lol
