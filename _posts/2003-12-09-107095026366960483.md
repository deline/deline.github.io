      <font color="#000000" size="-1"><br /> Your dominant hue is green. You&#8217;re logical and steadfast, focused on figuring life out and doing what makes sense. You value being trusted because you know you&#8217;re taking the time to figure things out and everyone should just follow you.</p>

      <p>
        Your saturation level is higher than average &#8211; You know what you want, but sometimes know not to tell everyone. You value accomplishments and know you can get the job done, so don&#8217;t be afraid to run out and make things happen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your outlook on life is brighter than most people&#8217;s. You like the idea of influencing things for the better and find hope in situations where others might give up. You&#8217;re not exactly a bouncy sunshine but things in your world generally look up.<br /> </font></td> </tr>

          How&#8217;s that for something kinda accurate? Well I&#8217;m pretty tired&#8230; dunno why maybe, but I&#8217;m not working tomorrow or Thursday so I&#8217;ll try get some sleep. Strange thing is I get like 7 &#8211; 8 hrs sleep a night&#8230; so it kind of doesn&#8217;t make sense at all. And I have a weird craving for a meat pie with barberque sauce for some reason&#8230; mmm.. but we have no pies at home.
