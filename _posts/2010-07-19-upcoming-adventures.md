  With the upcoming USA2010 adventures 6 or so weeks away there's no time like the present to get the travel blog in action. So in hope of more frequent blogging in the coming months, here's a post for July...
  
  So following up on the last post, have started getting into the trip research phase. Which for the time I'm away for equates to an awful lot of googling and wikitravel research. The long short list of places being visited is as follows though:
  
  <ul>
  <li>Las Vegas</li>
  <li>Utah (mainly Canyon Country)</li>
  <li>Wyoming/Montana</li>
  <li>Chicago</li>
  <li>Niagara Falls</li>
  <li>New York City</li>
  <li>Orlando</li>
  <li>Seattle</li>
  </ul>
  
  Having visited some of the national parks in the Arizona/Utah region before and being very in awe/impressed, is no surprise that a fair part of USA2010 is road tripping it from Vegas out through Utah and up into Wyoming/Montana visiting the National Parks along the way (see Google map on previous post).
  
  Parks that are on the list for visiting are: Bryce Canyon, Arches, Canyonlands, Grand Teton and Yellowstone. And apart from my slight fear of animals (monkeys in Asia, bears and bison in North America...) it hopefully will be pretty awesome with lots of cool geological features/formations and wildlife spotting. That said, gotta get my feet back into a hiking mode in the next 6 weeks.. seeing I have to hike to see <a href="http://www.google.com.au/images?hl=en&rlz=&=&q=delicate%20arch&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi">Delicate Arch</a> amongst other things.
  
  Other highlights I'm looking forward too is Orlando where I'm going to live like a kid for a week or so and hit up Disney World and Universal. Can't wait...
  
  So between now and when I leave it's time to finalise accomo and sort out trip things... as for post my mini career break (aka mid twenties/career crisis... lol) we'll see what pans out...
