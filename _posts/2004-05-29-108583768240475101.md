So I saw Super Size Me tonight, and it was pretty damn good. You have to keep an open mind though, about how accuracte (or unaccurate) it may be. A quick Google of the net reveals a person doing a similar thing, who has actually lost weight. Though the latter is making healthy choices, whereas Spurlock was following the choices many of us make, which I guess is possibly a more overall view of the population. Still nonetheless, if you haven&#8217;t seen it make sure you do. It&#8217;ll put you of fast food for a while!
