One of the silly things I saw today. Well it&#8217;s only silly if you know what to do really. There&#8217;s this website of a muscian. Now on the first page, they&#8217;ve got this flash player which plays tracks from the person&#8217;s new album. Now the stupid/silly thing is, it lets you play \*all\* tracks form the album, and it&#8217;s the \*whole\* track as well. Now, with sound recorders in existance, isn&#8217;t that kind of like promoting for vistors to just set the thing to loop through all songs, and record it? Personally, I&#8217;d have put a snippet of each song&#8230; not the whole album!
