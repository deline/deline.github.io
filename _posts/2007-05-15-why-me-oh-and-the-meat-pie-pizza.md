In the words of the consumer that is&#8230; a broken plastic salad box piece in my salad?!? In a totally different colour to the box my salad came in&#8230; it looked like capsicum actually&#8230;

But yes, [meat pie pizza](http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,21510044-2,00.html). After saying I was going to try it, I eventually got around to it on the weekend. And it actually doesn&#8217;t taste bad at all. It in fact would be one of the better pizzas from so called fast food pizza shops. I.e. it rates on par with the vego pizza. I&#8217;d definitely order it again, well at least over a supreme pizza anyday.
