After almost 5 years at [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) I&#8217;ve converted over to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/). I&#8217;d toyed with the idea for a number of years considering a number of solutions such as [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com/), [GreyMatter](http://www.noahgrey.com/greysoft/) and so on. But seeing the popularity of WordPress grow over the years, I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that if all these other bloggers out there are using it, there must be something good about it. Plus it has a built in tool to import posts and comments from your blogger account which is a plus. The past is kind of a historical memory to everything that has gone through my mind over the years. The headings are warped though, &#8216;cos in blogger I didn&#8217;t setup headings, so their represented by numbers here.

Keep checking back over the next few weeks as I further customise and tweek things here and there&#8230;
