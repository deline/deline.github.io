First things first, I stayed at uni till like almost 10pm last night. Latest I&#8217;ve stayed at Bld 10&#8230; Had a presentation and we were scheduled for 8:25pm but didn&#8217;t get to present till like 9:40pm&#8230; Silly thing was we sat there from 6pm onwards. It was a longgggggg night&#8230; but all&#8217;s well that ends well.

On a more light hearted note, I decided to sleep in till 8:30am today as I did not have to be at uni till 12 noon. Anyways my mobile started ringing at around 8:30&#8230; and at first I thought it was my alarm&#8230; but I snapped out of it and realised it really was my phone that was ringing and that my alarm was going to go off any second soon. When half asleep I&#8217;m known to just hang the phone up without knowing there was actually a person on the other side. Lucky I did not do that this time. Anyways it was a callback regarding the interview the other day. I was quite suprised &#8211; not at the early morning phone call &#8211; but that so far it&#8217;s still going okay. I must have sounded half asleep though, cos the person on the other side I think figured I just woke up&#8230; I&#8217;ve never spoken to myself when I&#8217;ve just woke up (obviously), so I don&#8217;t actually know how I sound when I just wake up&#8230;. if that makes sense.

Anyways I have to get back to summarising my work&#8230;
