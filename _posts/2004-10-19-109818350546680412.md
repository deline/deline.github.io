So sore&#8230; I feel like a little kid it makes me feel more comfortable when I grab my ear when I swallow. Argh sore. and its all red. To see the doctor or not is the question. Hopefully it&#8217;ll go away&#8230; I really do not want to have to take any more drugs. I think their killing all my healthy cells.

Hmm whenever I drink water it feels okay&#8230;.. but not eating, swallowing etc&#8230;.. any tips on what to eat/take to sooth it? honey maybe&#8230;..

off to watch tv&#8230;&#8230;
