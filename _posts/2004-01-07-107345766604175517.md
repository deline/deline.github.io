Life is fucking fucked sometimes!!! RIP L.H. 1985 &#8211; 2004, I hope life is better for you in your new home/place, unlike this sick twisted world that has caused this tragedy. It was great knowing you, even thought it wasn&#8217;t for that long, you were one of my good mates at uni. I&#8217;ll miss seeing you around/bumming with you whether in Building 10, down at Market City or elsewhere. Rest In Peace&#8230;.
