excerpt: |
  And windy at times over here, so jackets, gloves and beanies are in use. Prague is a very nice city but it has lots and lots of tourists. You can tell it when you are stuck between swarms of tour groups with their leader flying their 'flag' and also at the absurdity of the costs of things. Things that were free as early as 2 years ago now cost like $20 bucks to go in! For example some churches cost just under $10 bucks to go in... which for me is just a little too steep. It was good in Munich as you could visit things and they were reasonable and or free. Prague is just a little over tourist-ed...
  
  That said have enjoyed it, and am leaving tomorrow morning to Budapest. Can't wait to get home though...
