So I woke up around 6:20am and drove my mum to the hospital. Have to pick her up later in a few hours or so. Then came home has some brekky, read the news, then went to Maq to go to HMV. Slightly better, they had lots of copies of the 2CD version, but bad was no DVD&#8230; grrr. So I bought that, then had a look at shoes&#8230; shoess&#8230; mmm Vans or the Kustom ones??? Vans cooler, but can&#8217;t wear them to shows and stuff, &#8216;cos they&#8217;ll slide/fall off.

Um yeah now to do some work, going to movies tonight, cheap tuesdays to watch Princess Diaries 2.
