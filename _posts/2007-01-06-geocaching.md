So one of my friends had a GPS device and I gave them a linky to [Geocaching Australia](http://geocaching.com.au/). For those who haven&#8217;t heard of it before, [geocaching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching) is somewhat like a treasure hunt, where you have GPS coordinates to look for caches. A cache is like a stash of random treasure &#8211; when you find it you take something and leave something, so that way it&#8217;s always well stocked. These caches are left in random locations, so they often can be disturbed by non-geocachers &#8211; otherwise known as muggles. So if a cache is muggled, it&#8217;s been tampered with by people not knowing what it really is.

Anyways so tonight, we went on a little adventure looking for two caches in the general area. We managed to find one and traded a orange highlighter for a pink bouncy ball. It was half luck that we stumbled across it, because this hunt had multiple points we had to go to to get to the final location. And it looked like the cache had been muggled, so we put it back together and hopefully managed to hide it better. Then we went looking for another one&#8230; but failed miserably.

All in all interesting and fun adventure&#8230; if I ever get a GPS I&#8217;ll be randomly roaming suburbs and parks looking for caches&#8230;
