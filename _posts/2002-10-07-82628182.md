We bought a new computer today for my brother. It&#8217;s like a thousand times better than mine. 6 USB ports which are USB 2.0, P4 2ghz CPU, 60 GIG HDD, 64MB graphics (on board though, but still im on a 32MB card!)&#8230;&#8230;. oh well whilst I&#8217;d like all that speed, I get my computer back to myself. My lovely computer. Hehe&#8230; I&#8217;m attached to it, &#8216;cos I paid for alot of it, so it has a sense of ownership to it. But&#8230;.. I get a new box next year sometime I think, my mum and dad sort of said. And it can be desktop or laptop (I think). Swish eh I&#8217;d wait till prices drop more&#8230;. I&#8217;m cheap&#8230;. hahha&#8230; nah I only try to buy stuff when it&#8217;s worth it.
  
I HAVE MY COMPUTER TOO MYSELF!!!!!!!!! NO MORE JUNK CRAPPY SPYWARE CORRUPTING COMPONENTS LIKE GATOR!
  
and in a few weeks when I install W2K Pro, I can finally muck around more with VBScript and script logins&#8230;.. I read about that a while ago and it looked pretty nifty/cool. But that was around the time when I decided to become nerd for a year and neglect my computer. Oh man&#8230; that sounded pretty sad. But that was pretty much what I told myself.
