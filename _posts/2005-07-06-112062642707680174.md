Well just got back about half an hour or so ago from a day&#8217;s out bike riding. Rode from Putney (Ryde) to Brighton Le Sands via the Cooks River Cycleway. Met up at 8:30am and set off on our little adventure arriving in Brighton around 12 noon. We got lost a few times along the way as the signage wasn&#8217;t all that clear, especially around the Cantebury area, but after random riding around, we found the track again. Then after some hanging around Botany Bay / Brighton Le Sands, rode back to Tempe station and made our way back to Meadowbank for the ride home. And that has been my day in a nutshell&#8230;
