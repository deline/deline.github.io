Who&#8217;d have though that coffee cups could bring a whole new meaning to the word advertising? Whilst buying a hot chocolate today (or is that juju now?) I was thinking to myself, ‘Oh they have blue cups now…’, only to be amazed when I actually looked at the cup. I wonder if news.com.au is supplying the cups to the said café in question (not that I have anything against the café &#8211; they make quite good cappuccino).
