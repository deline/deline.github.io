Well so far not too bad. I&#8217;ve managed to get JDK, Apache, Tomcat and Eclipse up and running which is all I really need these days. Well that plus email and a web browser (which come default)&#8230; now if I can get my iPod to work properly, media files to play properly and tv-out to work I might just really give it a go on my real machine&#8230;

Of course me converting my real machine might not necessarily be a good thing&#8230; particularly when the word &#8216;tree&#8217; is associated with it.

Still I will admit I am a \*little\* bit impressed. It was a lot easier this time round (though my last venture into the world was about 6 years ago). It is somewhat pleasing to see that everything is auto mounted these days&#8230; &#8216;cos let me say that it was a pain to have to mount a floppy drive let alone having to mount the cd-rom to read a disc.
