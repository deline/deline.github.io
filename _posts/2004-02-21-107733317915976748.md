Deline &#8211; 7, Dad &#8211; 1.
  
I Win!!! Woot! I caught the most fish&#8230; though only one was of legal size &#8211; but I still won nonetheless. Yeah went to Clifton Gardens at a bit past 6 this morning. Quite a few people. These people caught quite a few big fish&#8230; some Kingfish and Bonito. Dammit I wanna catch a big fish too&#8230; always next time&#8230; and I sure as hell am going to use pilchard as bait next time instead of stinko chicken gut (which does work mind you). Can&#8217;t be bothered blogging much more today, so bye byes peoples&#8230;
