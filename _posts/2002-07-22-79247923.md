School starts tomorrow&#8230; and I still don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s good or bad. On a different note, this is yet another incarnation of my site&#8230;. the other one didn&#8217;t last long (only a week!)&#8230; at least this works in all resolutions&#8230; but i so liked my nav thingo on the other&#8230;. especially the grey/black/white scheme of things. What&#8217;s some other stuff that&#8217;s been happening? Well yesterday I went shopping.. well it was more meant to be a look at some formal dresses thing, because I don&#8217;t really plan on doing that next holidays. So&#8230;&#8230; i went an looked at formal dresses&#8230;. hell, I even tried a couple on&#8230;and suprisingly some weren&#8217;t that bad. But after that stint at checking out formal dresses, it was time to go clothes shopping. Looking back, the weekend was pretty okay, compared to the start of the week&#8230; which was.. shit. I tried not to do it because I knew if I did, I&#8217;d be tempted to do it again&#8230; but I haven&#8217;t since yet. Don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s good or bad really.
