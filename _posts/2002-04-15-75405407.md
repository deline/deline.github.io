To be or not to be? That is the freaking question. Well more of a case of what freaking homework I should do. Do I choose the english, and drown in puddles of metaphors and historical references? Or do I take the easy way out and work on my software assessment which I shouldn&#8217;t even be working on in the first place. Today is a question day. Guess I&#8217;m a bit of a thinker and it drives me insane sometimes, but I really can&#8217;t help it, it&#8217;s a characteristic of the introvert.
