Okay, so I&#8217;m not going to Splendour in the Grass but the lineup for it totally rocks. And the fact that there is a 99% chance going to be sideshows (since when has there never been?) means I will be staking Ticketek out for all that I can because&#8230; wait for it&#8230; Snow Patrol and Jose Gonzalez are coming to Australia!
