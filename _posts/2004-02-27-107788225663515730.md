Well following on from my post(s) yesterday, I guess I didn&#8217;t f up &#8216;cos Deline is now going to be a Lab Demonstrator. Woot! But it was so weird when I got the email, &#8216;cos there was meant to be somethign attached but it wasn&#8217;t. So I emailed of saying I didn&#8217;t think it was attached. But then I was really confused &#8216;cos I was pretty sure it would&#8217;ve been included so I checked the header, and the message was Multipart which means an attachment was attached. Then after checking that, Outlook mysteriously showed the attachment. It was \*really, really\* weird/strange. I have NFI as to why it happened, have never seen it happen before and hope it doesn&#8217;t happen again. Oh tomorrow dad and I are going to the Fish Markets to buy real Pilchard to go fishing with next week. We&#8217;re going night fishing on Friday coming home, then going fishing at like 5am again on Saturday morning! Crazy eh? but we really wanna catch a Kingfish! And then its the show on Sunday. Crazy weekend, hope it&#8217;s great.

Oh funny thing, this last week my brother has had a fascination with my CD collection&#8230; weird I say. But he&#8217;s been taxing my Powderfinger CD heaps and listened to my U2, Coldplay and Matchbox 20 ones too. Kinda annoying, &#8216;cos I don&#8217;t really like people just walking into my room.
