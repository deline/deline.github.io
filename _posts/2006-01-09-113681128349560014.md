Went to the movies today and saw [Fun With Dick and Jane](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369441/) (a remake of the 1977 film). Suprisingly it was actually pretty funny for a Jim Carrey movie ( most of his past ones I&#8217;ve seen haven&#8217;t really amused me that much). Basically married couple turn to crime to survive with lots of humourous moments along the way. Ahh and you have to love their little kid who speaks with an espaï¿½ol accent&#8230;
