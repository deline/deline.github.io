Thinking back to my other post the other day what if it we&#8217;re true? Then I wouldn&#8217;t be wrong in not wanting to &#8216;grow up&#8217; would I?

Oh today was also the semi&#8217;s and grandfinal games for Monday touch. The games are played back to back, but I could only play one, as I&#8217;m fairly busy with work and stuff. We won the first 3-0, and the second game 5-0&#8230;.
