I&#8217;m filling in my application for a school reference and I&#8217;m lost! I&#8217;m not sure how to disect what should be included and what should not. Hopefully whoever&#8217;s writing mine will be able to make sense of what I&#8217;ve written. I&#8217;m like flicking through this folder of mine in an attemp to see what I can find to include&#8230;.
  
Worse still I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m answering the questions properly&#8230; oh well if they&#8217;re too formal.. I couldn&#8217;t help it. All those uni applications.. I&#8217;m like permanently writing formal question answers now.
