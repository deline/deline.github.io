Hmmm am I glad we came back from Noosa last week. If we came back this week, we would&#8217;ve had hell of a lot of toruble getting back by train due to all the bushfires. Yesterday my mum brought back some sunglasses from her work. Normally I take ages to choose a pair of sunnies from her work, but these ones were cool. I think I went a bit overboard, as I told her to get me a pair in every colour. Why I&#8217;d want 5 pairs of sunnies which are the same model but in different colours I have no idea. Even weirder, was she said she would if I wanted me too. But then I thought and went&#8230; woah&#8230; I&#8217;m going over the top.. if they retail for over $100, and I get five thats like $500!. But I think I&#8217;m gonna get another pair. So I&#8217;ll have two. I&#8217;m definatley keeping the silver ones. And now I&#8217;m deciding between the slate one (which looks purple) or the pink ones. The bronze ones are okay, but I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll match my clothes. I&#8217;m not too sure about pink though because well it&#8217;s pink. Anyways I feel like downloading an mp3 so off I go.
