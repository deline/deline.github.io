Well RE is finished for the time being. Also had the DB test today. 7 outta 7. Whether or not the answers I got were correct we&#8217;ll have to wait and see. If they are, pretty happy with it then I guess. Though I think one I didn&#8217;t construct in the most efficent way because it took like 10 seconds to execute&#8230;

Hmm as of the last few day&#8217;s I&#8217;ve had the habit of saying the least expected things I would/usually say which ends up making everyone laugh. Take yesterday for example in a group convo in msn&#8230;.
  
I go &#8216;like what&#8217; to one of my friends questions regarding stuff on paper, another gone goes &#8216;your mum&#8230; sorry&#8217;, but I respond with a &#8216;nah my mum won&#8217;t fit on the paper (unfortunatley)&#8217;&#8230; haha they weren&#8217;t expecting that. Though for the record that wasn&#8217;t mean to imply anything else, except be a quick witted response back. The today one of my friends get bagged out by the other about a specifc word/thing, and we walk ahead and she&#8217;s going about how the only way we can escape the others is to walk ahead, and how she can listen to the cars and herself without them saying the word&#8230; then I blurt out the word&#8230; haha&#8230;&#8230;.

Okay not that interesting, but its a side of me which doesn&#8217;t surface very much unless I&#8217;m in some weird/crazy mode/mood. Haha and then today I suggested we leave the lecture midway which we did&#8230; though we kinda all wanted too &#8216;cos we had a test next.

But yeah that&#8217;s my news for the day&#8230;

Oh don&#8217;t you love these lyrics&#8230;

Maybe I don&#8217;t really want to know
      
How your garden grows
      
I just want to fly
      
Lately did you ever feel the pain
      
In the morning rain
      
As it soaks it to the bone</p> 

Maybe I just want to fly
      
I want to live I don&#8217;t want to die
      
Maybe I just want to breath
      
Maybe I just don&#8217;t believe
      
Maybe you&#8217;re the same as me
      
We see things they&#8217;ll never see
      
You and I are gonna live forever

Maybe I don&#8217;t really want to know
      
How your garden grows
      
I just want to fly
      
Lately did you ever feel the pain
      
In the morning rain
      
As it soaks it to the bone

Maybe I will never be
      
All the things that I want to be
      
But now is not the time to cry
      
Now&#8217;s the time to find out why
      
I think you&#8217;re the same as me
      
We see things they&#8217;ll never see
      
You and I are gonna live forever
      
We&#8217;re gonna live forever
      
Gonna live forever
      
Live forever
      
Forever
