One of the subjects I&#8217;m doing this semester whilst very theoretical is quite interesting due to the sociology aspects present. What&#8217;s so interesting about this you say? Well today I was the subject of a question in my tute. I can&#8217;t remember the situation completely, but basically the topic was about particpation and so on, and I was the subject of the &#8216;thinker&#8217; personality type. Basically as the tutor mentioned we have 100&#8217;s of thoughts running through our mind, and we contribute when something is either totally off track or if we feel strongly about the issue. And I agreed with it 101% &#8211; it&#8217;s exactly how I operate. It&#8217;s the very reason why essay&#8217;s are so painful to write. All the thoughts are running through your mind, all the information is there, but when it come&#8217;s to writing it, it is very difficult to translate all those ideas into written form.
