The Baghdad Blogger, Salam Pax was on breakfast radio this morning. It was pretty interesting even though it was only for about 4 or 5 minutes. He speaks English very fluently, very good in fact. It was good to hear that he still had that witty quick sense of humour with his replies to questions and stuff. That was my interesting amusement for today I must say.

Otherwise it&#8217;s back to uni crap. Starting to get stressed&#8230;
