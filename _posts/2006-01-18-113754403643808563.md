Some good quotes&#8230;

&#8220;That&#8217;s not a dog, it&#8217;s a hyena escaped from the zoo dressed in dog clothing&#8221;
  
&#8220;There is a land called Passive Aggressiva&#8230; and I am their queen&#8221;

and yes the weather is overcast, humid and rainy again&#8230; though I suppose rain is good even if it means I can&#8217;t play outside.
