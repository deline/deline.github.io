So I&#8217;d only booked 3 nights and was going to find a cheaper place for tonight. But then last night whilst falling asleep I was like WTF i can&#8217;t be bothered packing my stuff. So this morning I went down to see if I could&#8230; but that had a booking already. So I kind of madly packed up and started walking up the river. Found a place for $3 USD cheaper, but it&#8217;s a bit of a hike back down to where I have to catch my bus tomorrow. Could&#8217;ve been worse I suppose.

Anyways have to now find mysef a moto driver for the day&#8230; as I have to get about 18KM south of the Indepence Monument&#8230; tuk tuk or moto that is the question of the day&#8230;
