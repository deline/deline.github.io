Well well, looks like the rumour mill held true this time, and the [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/au/itunes/) store is now available in Australia. Now the big question is should I buy an iPod now, or wait till next year when they&#8217;ll more than likely release one with better video playback features? Well I guess that&#8217;s technology for you&#8230; changes so rapidly. On the upnote, they have the last The Hippos album they released after they broke up, so I&#8217;ll have to buy/download that one.
