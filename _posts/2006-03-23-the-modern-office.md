[The modern office: so much eating, so little time](http://www.smh.com.au/news/heckler/the-modern-office-so-much-eating-so-little-time/2006/03/21/1142703355826.html). That is like so true&#8230; I eat breakfast at work now. It&#8217;s a lot more convenient then trying to wake up, get dressed, eat AND make the bus on time in the morning. But I&#8217;m not a toaster, or a spooner. I have a stash of breakfast bars in my bottom drawer&#8230; though I guess that&#8217;s a spooner without the milk? Hmm a box of coco pops on my shelf might be nice though&#8230; you never know when you might just get hungry. And yep sandwich eating is out the door, unless you are one of the gourmet sandwhich preparers who make them at work. Hmm I think I now need to stock up on a youghurt stash&#8230;
