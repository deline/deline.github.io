Plus all our backpacks, daypacks and some guys bicycle. I was one of the last to get in, and hence was one of the &#8216;standing passengers&#8217;. It was damn crazy like seriously hold on for dear life &#8216;cos the road was dirt with ditches and stuff at least 80% of the way. I suppose on the other hand it means my arm muscles might just be a little bit stronger??? But there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m doing it again&#8230; I reckon it was pretty lucky that we didn&#8217;t roll, &#8216;cos at one sideways ditch thingo&#8230;

Anyways so I arrived here, and I was supposed to have someone pick me up, but there wasn&#8217;t anyone there&#8230; so I got into the city and looked at a few places. I couldn&#8217;t be bothered walking much so the place I looked at first (with the free ride in) had no rooms in my range so I picked the next closest. $3 a night only cold water though&#8230; I can handle that as long as there is no insects&#8230; so we&#8217;ll see tomorrow.

Edit:to add some pictures&#8230;

First pic: One of the pickups being loaded up. Add to the backpacks being loaded on at the back another 2 layers and their corresponding owners to get a better idea.

Secondpic: Self taken on the one I was in.We were stilll loading up then. Eventually Another 2 guys hopped in behind me, and there is also a person right in front of me who hadnot stoodup yet. Not exactly the bestest pic, but rather one that had to be taken. I think a coupleof other people took crazy photos along the way, but me standing up was somewhat impossible&#8230;including taking a drink as I was super thirsty but lucky someone caught me in time, as just as I have my hands free the guy decides to start driving again!
