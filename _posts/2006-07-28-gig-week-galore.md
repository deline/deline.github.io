Well not quite, but having two gigs on consecutive nights starting the working week made for a very long week for me. That said, it was awesome &#8211; the gigs at least. Monday night was Snow Patrol and that was super cool. Kinda sucks that they only played stuff from Final Straw and Eyes Open, but they played all the good stuff&#8230;.. Tuesday TV On The Radio at the Gaelic Club. Great fun there too. The rest of the week was pretty standard. Work, work the usual. This evening headed for drinks after work to GPO again&#8230; I think I have to get used to being the only chick who goes&#8230; meh
