Lol you have to listen to [this](http://www.bombshell.live.com.au/Frenzal_Fox_FM_Interview.mp3) or at least read [this](http://www.outwiththenew.com/html/news.html)!. It&#8217;s Jay from Frenzal Rhomb taking on Jackie O and Kyle from 2Day FM. Funny shit&#8230; lol like a slagging match on air in some parts.

The Living End are touring again. Probably won&#8217;t see them this time as I&#8217;ve seen them 4 times already. Though its to coincide with their first DVD &#8211; From Here On In, and also the release of From Here On In Singles from 1997 &#8211; 2004 which I will def have to get both off them.
