Random sight for today (maybe I&#8221;ll make it a daily occurance?) in the city, on the bus, and this whole flock of Lorikeets flew by. Like when I mean a whole flock I mean a big flock. It was a surreal site, seeing so many colourful birds flying down a city street. It&#8217;s like something I&#8217;d expect in the suburbs, not in the middle of a smog filled city centre.

Also why oh why did I only find out about the [Foo Fighters show](http://www.bombshellzine.com/newspage/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=744) this morning? By the time I found out which was almost 10, there was no point heading up to the Metro&#8230; then again I s&#8217;pose I was asleep by the time the message was posted, so it&#8217;s not like I would&#8217;ve know. Unless I checked my comp before I came to uni. Oh well&#8230; always next time.
