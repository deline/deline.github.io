  I'd been meaning to do a wrap up post but never got round to it. Got some time this evening so here it is.

  So all in all, trip was awesome... liked America way more than I expected. So for the best, worst and oddities...

  <b>Best</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Disneyland
  <li>Las Vegas
  <li>Zion National Park
  <li>Budapest - partly due to the Hungarian currency tanking whilst we were there, and hence us becoming 'rich' and stuffing ourselves silly at dinner...
  </ul>

  <b>Worst</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Way too many tourist bus type tours in Prague
  <li>BMW museum - I'm not a big fan of cars...
  </ul>

  <b>Oddities</b>
  All of these are from America...
  <ul>
  <li>Prepaying your petrol before you filled. This was actually quite a pain. Firstly the things in gallons, your driving a car you don't know how far the mileage goes on a tank, and you can't use the machine at the bowser because you have an international credit card and hence 'enter your zip code' doesn't really mean much.
  <li>Petrol stations where you have to pay for an undisclosed amount of air?!? To add weirdness the air filly things didn't even have a gauge, so you couldn't tell how much more you needed to fill the tyre.
  <li>Lamingtons in Budapest
  </ul>


  Oh and there has to be a list dedicated to best food experiences...
  <ul>
  <li>The Buffet at the Bellagio, Las Vegas
  <li><a href="http://www.menza.co.hu/">Menza</a>, Budapest. Best food ever, so much so 3 of 4 nights was where dinner was had. Deviated once and it was terrible so decision made, to eat where it was good.
  <li>Chocolate butter kek from Aldi, Munich - and they have the exact same ones here in Aldi, imported from Germany but with a different name... Tastes good 'cos the EU have a law where chocolate has to be at least 25% cocoa solids... the Aldi chocolate - 35%
  </ul>
