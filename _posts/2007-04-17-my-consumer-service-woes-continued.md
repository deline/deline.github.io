Okay maybe it should be product related woes&#8230; but they&#8217;ve all become one and the same to me. The day before the overnight hike I went to the supermarket to stock up on food. One of my purchases was a packet of dried fruit mix&#8230; it&#8217;s got taste, packs easily doesn&#8217;t need any other special attention. I ate some of it and had about half a packet left.

Well I&#8217;d started eating the rest of it earlier this evening when I got home from work, and I was going to eat more&#8230; until I for some reason looked at the back and it said in nice writing: Best Before DEC 2006. Now I know you can eat stuff after the Best Before date, but it&#8217;s like 4 months after that I even bought it. And stuff past it&#8217;s best before shouldn&#8217;t be sold in theory. Even [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelf_life) says so (not that Wikipedia is the be all and end all to anything&#8230;).
