Woot well we finally got tickets to RHCP. Our crazy plan didn&#8217;t work quite right either. I looked at King Street ticketek at like 8am in the morning and there were like 50+ peopl, 20 of which had camped out over night. Whilst over at Olympic Park there we&#8217;re also 50+ people (had one mate out there trying as well). The internet was crap as well because session limits were on and there were way to many users trying to get through, and phones weren&#8217;t any better. The first and second show pretty much sold out in minutes. Lucky there was a third, and even though my mate was like right at the front, we still couldn&#8217;t get GA &#8216;cos according to what I&#8217;ve seen (and heard) the GA tix were all sold/held even before the third gig went on sale. Basically you pay certain companies a bit more, and once the tickets go on sale they hold/get them immediatley (I&#8217;ve done it before for Coldplay). The sale of RHCP tixs was what one would call crazy, we only managed 3rd elevation seating. 3 shows all sold out in about less than 3 hours! No wonder their not playing BDO (which they were going to until they got too &#8216;big&#8217;).

Moving onto the songs on rotation part (seeing as this is a music post and all)&#8230;. but I really really love [The Fray&#8217;s](http://www.thefray.net/) How To Save A Life album. Crap, I just found out they are doing a gig at the Gaelic Club next week, but it&#8217;s sold out&#8230; damn. Other songs that getting replay action is Van Morrison&#8217;s Sweet Thing. Oh and in a bit of a üôÅ moment, I&#8217;ve lost half my Stereophonics Live From Dakota cd which sucks. It was a 2 cd thingo and I&#8217;ve only got disc 2???? I think I lost it when I was cleaning my room, &#8216;cos I recall putting it in to play, except now I can&#8217;t find the other half&#8230; meh and I liked that cd a lot&#8230;
