I had an idea for a a Google Maps [Mashup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)) so I set about going about it yesterday thinking it was going to be pretty straight forward. Turns out I had to learn a bit a bout [Ajax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX_%28programming%29) which was good/bad. Anyways so I had bits of my mashup working and I couldn&#8217;t for the life work out why a piece of code wasn&#8217;t working the way it should&#8230; half a day later it clicks&#8230;. the variable wasn&#8217;t global!&#8230;&#8230;. argh&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..

Anyways back to the mashup it is&#8230; there were better ideas for mashups I had, but the lack of publically available data in Australia kinda sucks at that&#8230;
