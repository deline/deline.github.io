The weather is eek&#8230; hot and sticky still after it&#8217;s stormed/rained. Going out in a few hours to have dinner with friends in the city&#8230; \*wonders if this is what grown ups do???\* Worked all last week (I think I did??) Next week not so much. Have Monday off, but I have to go up Cherrybrook way to troubleshoot a wireless network of some family friends. Then maybe on Wed to Thurs bum at Narrabeen &#8211; I have to check on that one anyways. Then work Fri the weekend and then its back to uni&#8230; woot. Mmm in other news I \*may\* (not even sure at the moment) have a job demo-ing (and maybe tutoring?) at uni again this semester. They have to see how first year numbers go, and see how many people they need to hire. I wouldn&#8217;t mind doing it again. I wouldve loved to do it last semester but timetable clashes. Only problem is its on Thursday which is my free day I was going to work at RGHS. Though I suppose I can work on Wed&#8230; but the other guy is working most of the week anyway, and with the other person one a week, so I probably wont be missed. We&#8217;ll see. I wouldn&#8217;t mind a slight change in the work aspect for a while and it&#8217;s a really great experience.
