Wednesday mid week&#8230; this is the point where the week starts ending and starts feeling shit&#8230; or in this case dies down for a bit. Mmm I think I should be okay with DB now, realised it&#8217;s possible to do what i was thinking, but I&#8217;ll have to explicitly state it otherwise it might not be noticeable&#8230;

Hmm you know today I made more phone calls than I usually would make in a month (this was for work related stuff)&#8230; in case you hadn&#8217;t realised, I ain&#8217;t really a phone person&#8230; email, sms or some other means. The phone is so&#8230; I don&#8217;t know&#8230; you can actually hear the person&#8230; obviously&#8230; but yeah.

And my room is an fscking mess at the moment&#8230; not dirty as in gross unhygenic, but just messy and dusty around the table. I should, and wanna clean it but I think I&#8217;ll leave it till exams is over, another 3-4 weeks at the most&#8230; getting scared about exams. I know this will be the worst semester I&#8217;ve ever performed so far&#8230; :-S
