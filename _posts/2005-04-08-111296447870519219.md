Mmm testing was okay today, though I&#8217;m not to sure about the Temprement side of the test, its hard when the 4 options given all rate highly to you, but u have to pick one which is the most and one which is the least. Oh well what&#8217;s done is done&#8230; only now is to play the waiting game and hope for the best&#8230; that&#8217;s all one can do really. But I made it to the next round for Westpac too, so I&#8217;ve just done their test today as well, and I&#8217;ll probably find out sometime next week how that went. Wish me luck there too&#8230;

Oooh&#8230; randomness, ever had blisters on the bank of your ankles so sore, than its been hard to walk? I was going to drive home barefoot (never done it before, &#8216;cos never have been able to), but had to stop half way, because my foot kept slipping/not comfortable on the clutch&#8230; so now my feet are like mega sore and I don&#8217;t feel like wearing shoes for the next two days!
