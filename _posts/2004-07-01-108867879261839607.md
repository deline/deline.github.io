Blah had another power blackout today. So weird that we can go like 10+ years without having one during &#8216;awake&#8217; hours to have like 2 in 2-3 months or so. Funny &#8216;cos after the last one, it said the Meadowbank substation was one which failed a bit (made the list of most occuring faults) but we&#8217;d never noticed. Anyways today the power was out for a bit more than an hour. Got bored waiting around doing nothing in the light of only candles when I realised that I could use my laptop! So off I went to play spider solitaire&#8230; and I actually won a game&#8230; lol

That&#8217;s about it really&#8230;
