Well yesterday I started looking a websites and I found out the grad job applications had been open since mid Feb and were closing in April so I started applying. I probably should have put mre thought into some of the applications but I&#8217;m still a bit up in the air over what I&#8217;m going to do. I&#8217;ve figured now if I get a job I may as well take it, but I also still have the travel bug, or rather the bug to pack up and move at least half way to the other side of the world. I guess I will have to see how things go. In other news I have my first Plant ID test tomorrow. I hope it doesn&#8217;t go to bad. I actually would like to do good in the subject, not just to keep my average up, but also because even though it&#8217;s hard I don&#8217;t really mind it too much as I have to put in heaps of effort. We&#8217;ll see on that too. Listening to [My Kind of Scene by Powderfinger](http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=13860) at the moment. Weirdly meaningful at this current point in life&#8230;
