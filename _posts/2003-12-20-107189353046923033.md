Mmm so in the last few days, I&#8217;ve been to The Living End show (it rocked! as per usual), got my uni results, went lawn bowling, been to the movies&#8230; Uni results were kind of okay&#8230; a bit less than I would&#8217;ve liked, but I guess I&#8217;m still happy with them. DCA made them a lot better. I owned DCA!!! 98!!!. As I know I got 8/10 for my speech, thats where I lost the 2 marks. Which means I got fullmarks for both exams and the assignment&#8230; woot! 90/90 for my assignment&#8230; that was a pretty damn cool assignment though.. and you could kind of say I loved it to some degree&#8230; if you&#8217;d seen my previous highschool IPT assignment you&#8217;d see what I mean. Anyways it&#8217;s my mum&#8217;s birthday party tonight, so things are pretty crazy here. She&#8217;s turning the big 5 &#8211; 0. So I should have a shower soon, cos I have to drop my cousins back home then go pick Sal up. Laters
