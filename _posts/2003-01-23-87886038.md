After procrastinating over installing MySQL and PHP onto my computer because it (the computer) was semi gluggly, I found the time to ghost it today. Tidied up My Documents and my D drive, then installed MySQL and PHP yay&#8230; I even downloaded the JDBC driver for MySQL so I might dabble in Java these coming days&#8230; I don&#8217;t know Java or PHP? PHP is more ASP style, but I should learn Java &#8216;cos that&#8217;s used more in the enterprise world&#8230;

Ahh I also did some work as well today which was good!&#8230; Tomorrow I have to go to the city again, but this time not to shop but enrol @ UTS. &#8216;Twill be interesting to see where the camp is at&#8230; also to see who&#8217;ll be doing the course&#8230; I don&#8217;t know anyone at all&#8230;. üôÅ
