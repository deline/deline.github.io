This weekend has involved so far finishing SITPP and working more on my Contemporary Enviro Issues essay&#8230; it&#8217;s annoying &#8216;cos I know exactly what I want to write, but I can&#8217;t organise it properly into sections! (or maybe it&#8217;s just plain old procrastination?).

But I did make it out to buy a new [sleeping bag](http://blackwolf.com.au/engine/SID/1000046/AID/100101.htm). Choosing sleeping bags is harder than you think. You have weight verses price verses warmth to consider. I originally was going to buy the Roman Palm IV, but it was a bit heavier than the Black Wolf and I didn&#8217;t like the compression sack/bag. On the other hand, the Coleman one was nice&#8230; 700 grams, rated to -2 degrees, but a little over my budget. Now all I need is a pack &#8216;cos the other one is to large and top loading&#8230;
