[The Reporter &#8211; 20,000 and counting](http://www.wisinfo.com/thereporter/news/archive/local_16969524.shtml) &#8211; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve even eaten anywhere near 50 big macs alone. Definatley cheesburgers but big macs are like way to messy and taste overly manufactuerd. Oh I still haven&#8217;t eaten Macca&#8217;s since seeing SSM. That must&#8217;ve been a good 2-3 months ago now&#8230;
