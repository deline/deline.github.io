It&#8217;s Wednesday morning. I woke up at 5.30am today. I just couldn&#8217;t sleep any longer. Weird thing was I went to bed at like past 11pm&#8230;.. I wonder what happened to my usual 8 hours or more of sleep? I&#8217;ve been on my computer since.. just lisetning to music and surfing around.

When I came home yesterday, I made a pact not to do any work for the night. Just relax. But it didn&#8217;t really work. After am hour of doing nothing, I couldn&#8217;t take it any longer and had to take out some Maths HSC papers to do. It&#8217;s so weird&#8230; I can&#8217;t not do any study, it&#8217;s like second nature, come home, take out textbooks, notes, papers and sit for like 4 or more hours reading, summarising, doing papers. I must be going crazy. Anyways I&#8217;m going to go have a shower or something&#8230;&#8230;I need some cold water to fully wake me up. Laters&#8230;..
