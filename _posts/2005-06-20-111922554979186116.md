I&#8217;ve got my hands on two tickets to the Oasis gig on the 28th of Nov. Left home around 7am to get to the city to join the queue, as I was not missing this show if I could help it. Anyways got to the city and there wasn&#8217;t really anyone there, well there were 2-3 guys so I went and got a drink and sat across the road. At close to 8am, the queue started getting longer so I went to join it for my place at position 7. It was a v. long wait till 9am! In about 5 minutes, just under 3000 tickets had been sold >.
