Hmm I didn&#8217;t do too bad in my software test, but not as bad as I thought. Eh backward chaining&#8230;. had no idea I could refer to the pictures&#8230;. and just work in order down the list&#8230;. me thought I had to prove that the order was correct, but thought it was more complex than just stepping down the rules&#8230;.. yuk&#8230;. eh oh well like said in two posts down, Anything Learnt Is Good!
  
School&#8217;s almost out! School&#8217;s almost out! Yes as you can read I&#8217;m waiting till that day. Not that I don&#8217;t like school or anything, but after 13 years of school, its like amazingish that it&#8217;s time to leave everything behind. No more 1000 word essays on how language makes meaning! I never was good at things like that&#8230;.oh well. I better get back to my maths revision. I wonder if it&#8217;s possible to information overload your brain with too many maths formulas&#8230;..
