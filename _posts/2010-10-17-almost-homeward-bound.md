excerpt: |
  So it's time tomorrow for a flight down the west coast back to Vegas which means the USA 2010 adventures are almost at an end.

  The time here in Seattle has been rather nice. Good food and coffee and time to relax and recover from hectic adventures. Made the trip up the Space Needle and out to the Boeing factory and also did a ferry trip out to Bainbridge Island for breakfast and a walkabout.

  As there's not really any free wifi in Vegas, you'll probably hear from me when I'm back home...
