Reel Big Fish last Friday night was f@#$#n awesome! I&#8217;d rate it on the same scale as when I saw The Living End at Homebake years ago. So so good &#8211; one band I&#8217;d definatley see again if they&#8217;re back in Aus. On Sat night went to that Of Angels and Light thingo with Sal, was good. Sunday when swimming at Clovelly that was nice too. Decided will attempt to swim weekly from now on. Is good exercise, and as is weightless, will not be so harsh on my joints/muscles (hopefully). On Monday went to the funeral, had to drive to Fairfield then to Rookwood&#8230; It was sad, so final&#8230; 🙁 On the way got lost and landed up in Old Guildford >..
