Okay, so you&#8217;re probably going what?!? Looking back on last week&#8217;s posts I forgot to post about it, but last week&#8217;s Saturday afternoon involved a trip to the Sydney Eye Hospital to pick up my dad&#8230; Moving to this weekend&#8217;s hospital adventure&#8230; my brother broke his collarbone. So it&#8217;s my dad&#8217;s turn this week to do the trips&#8230; first it was to Drummoyne Medical, then on to Balmain Hospital who said it was a bad break and to go on to Royal Prince Alfred which is where they&#8217;ve been since. More news to come soon&#8230;
