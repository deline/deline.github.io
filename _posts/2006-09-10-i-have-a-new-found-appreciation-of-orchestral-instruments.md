So I caught Ben Folds and the SSO last night with Trish at the Opera House. I&#8217;m really glad I bought tickets to it, &#8216;cos it was pretty damn awesome if you ask me. Having an orchestra which is normally associated with classicial/symphpny music, really made for a very interesting musical experience, adding all these other layers previously not present. Songs I really liked&#8230; Still Fighting It, Army, One Angry Dwarf and 200 Solemn Faces. Brick was good, but it didn&#8217;t really have the full orchestra supporting it so for me, it was like hearing the normal version in a way. Argh now I have this need to listen to big band music&#8230;
