As the subject goes&#8230; it just took me absolutely ages to configure the VCR. Why was I configuring the VCR you may ask? I was trying to make it get it&#8217;s feed through the set top box to know avail, then in the process stuffed up the tuning which I then had to work out how to reset. I&#8217;d have RTFM if I knew where on earth it was. The reasons behind this all however comes from me realising the doco [Born Into Brothels](http://www.thinkfilmcompany.com/brothels/) is showing on SBS tonight at 10pm. Ironically when I was browsing in the DVD section of Borders on the weekend I had spotted this doco, and thought it sounded interesting enough to put in my mind as a possible future purchase.
