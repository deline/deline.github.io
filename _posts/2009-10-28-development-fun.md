  Just a random page dedicated to things I've developed/toyed with... gotta get round to putting in links and screenshots though as some of these items I haven't touched/seen in years! That or I've abandoned it.
  
  <ul>
  <li>WebGen - intranet generator</li>
  <li><a href="http://riversideghs.nsw.edu.au/">Riverside Girls High website</a> - Developed this whilst I was back in high school. Haven't had much to do with it in recent years, but am currently working on a Drupal project to do with the site.</li>
  <li><a href="http://delineneo.com/mashups/">Sydney Mashups</a> - my foray into Google Maps. Abandoned because at the time there was a severe lack of free data in Australia (and I didn't own a GPS!). Though <a href="http://data.australia.gov.au/">data.australia.gov.au</a> is looking very promising.
  <li>jQuery plugin - <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/project/SimpleLabel">Simple Label</a></li>
  </ul>
  
  I'm sure there's also some other random stuff I can't remember about... I remember there was a spider like script in vbscript!... eek

  * WebGen &#8211; intranet generator
  * [Riverside Girls High website](http://riversideghs.nsw.edu.au/) &#8211; Developed this whilst I was back in high school. Haven&#8217;t had much to do with it in recent years, but am currently working on a Drupal project to do with the site.
  * [Sydney Mashups](http://delineneo.com/mashups/) &#8211; my foray into Google Maps. Abandoned because at the time there was a severe lack of free data in Australia (and I didn&#8217;t own a GPS!). Though [data.australia.gov.au](http://data.australia.gov.au/) is looking very promising. 
      * jQuery plugin &#8211; [Simple Label](http://plugins.jquery.com/project/SimpleLabel)</ul>
