One two buckle my shoe&#8230; ahh I&#8217;m in a weird tired mood today. I guess waking up at 3:15am to check Ebay wasn&#8217;t a very good idea. Especially because I got auction sniped in the last 54 seconds! But yeah the weather has also been the type that gives me the feeling of wishing I could just sit at the top of a mountain and feel the breeze and breath the coldness of the air. And yeah it&#8217;s when it&#8217;s like that, that everything around me seems surreal and there is meaning in nothing much.

Been listening to different stuff this week, Something For Kate, Oasis and Something Corporate. Mmm yeah &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. what&#8217;s the story morning glory?
