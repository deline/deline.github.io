Just watched the video clip for the Manic Street Preachers song If You Tolerate This Then Your Children Will Be Next. It&#8217;s a bit morbid in a sense, like the doll EC from Lift Off (if anyone can actually remember that show). But now its back to Need For Speed then onto a bike ride&#8230;

_The future teaches you to be alone

the present to be afraid and cold

&#8216;So if I can shoot rabbits

then I can shoot fascists

&#8216;Bullets for your brain today

but we&#8217;ll forget it all again

Monuments put from pen to paper

turns me into a gutless wonder_
