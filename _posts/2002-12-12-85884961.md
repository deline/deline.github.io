Well what&#8217;s been happening this week? I started work training, which was pretty cool/ace. Other than that I&#8217;ve been listening to music, watching movies and web designing (somewhat related to work too). Which is a reminder that I have to make some phone calls tonight. Actually I might leave them till tomorrow morning-ish.
  
On another note, there&#8217;s now less than one week before HSC results come out. Hmm I wonder if I&#8217;ll be able to sleep Wednesday night? Probably so, but I&#8217;ll then probably wake up real early&#8230; then be tired the rest of the day.
  
Why am I listening to a doof doof music song?!?!?! It&#8217;s the only one in my playlist&#8230; actually in all of my music collection (CDs and mp3s)&#8230; I need to change songs&#8230; now&#8230; to the Foo Fighters.
  
Is my Blog boring? It&#8217;s starting to get boring&#8230; I feel like I&#8217;m talking to myself&#8230; Does anyone read this? Hmm don&#8217;t tell me if you do&#8230; well you can if you really want to. That was a bit of a disjointed sentence.
  
I wonder why I wonder
  
I wonder why I wonder why
  
I wonder _why_ I wonder
  
I wonder why I wonder why
  
I wonder why I wonder&#8230;

WTF?!?!
