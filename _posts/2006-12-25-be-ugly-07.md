In 2007 &#8216;UGLY can be beautiful&#8217; according to the [Be Ugly campaign](http://www.beugly07.com/) which of course features good ole&#8217; Betty in her awesomely [ugly] outfits. But on my quoted bit, I find it kind of funny, because of the &#8216;can&#8217;&#8230;. if ugly \*can\* be beautiful, doesn&#8217;t that mean that ugly can mean ugly?

Either way&#8230; be ugly, have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year enjoy the silly season whilst it lasts&#8230;
