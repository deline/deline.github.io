Approximately 3 and a half weeks remain. A few years ago, 3 and a half weeks would have seemed like eternity to me, but now, it&#8217;s nothing. It&#8217;s like the equivalent of waking up tomorrow morning really. In fact, the last 3 years have gone by in a flash. Sure there were the moments &#8211; especially in the early part &#8211; when I had many moments of doubt, but now, everything is kind of I guess good? In a way I can&#8217;t wait to see what the future holds. I have a few plans up my sleeve, but my main goal on the horizon is to go RTW before I&#8217;m 30 on a year long sabbatical.
