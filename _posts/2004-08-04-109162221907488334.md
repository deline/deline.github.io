So I had my first lecture thingo today. And was quite suprised to find that the subject is one which is heaps diff in teaching that I thought. No more formal lectures. The lecture time is class discussion. So basically I have 3 hours of class discussions for one subject as my contact hours. Kinda similar to SDP except realise for SDP lectures wouldn&#8217;t be too much use. Still BPIT on first glances appears really well organised so that is good. Plus it&#8217;ll be interesting.

Other than that, since I&#8217;ve come home form uni an eaten dinner (so since like maybe 8.45pm?) I&#8217;ve been fiddling with IIS. Blah so fiddley to configure. Especially since last time I set it up where I changed the windows xp home files so it&#8217;d run but now i&#8217;m using pro :-S It seems to be working now. Had to create accounts add to groups set up the FTP server thingo to point to the right folder etc. First time I&#8217;d bothered trying the FTP server setup. But seems okay.

So now I think it is time to sleeps, cos SDP tomorrow&#8230;
