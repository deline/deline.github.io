Did [The Coast Track](http://www.totaltravel.com.au/travel/nsw/illawara/coalcoast/guide/coast-track) over the weekend with some of the crew. Left Eastwood around 7:30ish Sat morning bound for Otford arriving a bit after 10am I think. Then started walking. Had a swim at Garie beach mid afternoon then plodded on to the campsite arriving round 5:30pm. Up at 6am today to eat/pack and continue on.

Was good&#8230; even though I think today I was walking really slow, so probably slowed the group down. Courtesy of one ginormous blister on the bottom of my fourth left toe (i swear it&#8217;s as large as a fingernail!), and two others not that huge on my right foot. So now I hobble &#8216;cos it&#8217;s damn hard to walk normally and not roll onto them.

Along the way saw quite a few animals&#8230; an echinda(!), a goanna, dolphins, lizards, bush cockroaches, a leg carcass of some kangaroo like animal, ugly looking pufferfish and a snake (I didn&#8217;t see it), that I apparently almost stepped on.

Other than that super tired&#8230;. and I should head to sleep &#8216;cos I got another late night tomorrow&#8230;. heading to U2 after work.
