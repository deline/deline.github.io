omg, omg, omg&#8230;. well not as exaggerated as such, but more shock surprise (though definatley positive). In short, for those of you in the loop about the happenings in my life, one of my other dreams/goals/ambitions has eventuated. I was like \*\*wow\*\*&#8230; I mean I knew it was close, but part of me thought I was on the outer having dropped a year of the course in order to graduate which removed the additional experiences and all. And in a nutshell, everyone else was just as worthy. Ahhhhhhhhh only in my wildest dreams&#8230; and I guess I can now say for sure that your dreams really can come true. Believe in oneself&#8230;
