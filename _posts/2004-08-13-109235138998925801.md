Oh last night I finally downloaded SP2 and installed it. Wahh your going, its not available yet, well it most certainly is from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=049c9dbe-3b8e-4f30-8245-9e368d3cdb5a&DisplayLang=en) at Microsoft. But its the install more for company&#8217;s so their not promoting it and rather are telling people to turn automatic updates on. Supposed the other install is to be smaller in size. But yeah if your on broadband, download&#8230; It&#8217;s okay I guess, it does have some changes which in the scope of Windows XP are fairly large. IE now has a pop up blocker (but still no tabbed browsing), the firewall management is new and asks you about specific programs wanting internet access. And the wireless network configuration has had a complete overhaul.
