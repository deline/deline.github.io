[A modest proposal: Let&#8217;s eat Japanese scientists | The Nation | Breaking News 24/7 &#8211; NEWS.com.au (08-06-2005)](http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,15543300-421,00.html) If you&#8217;d ask me to eat whale or scientist, I think I&#8217;d choose the former. Human doesn&#8217;t bring taste to my tastebuds. That said I haven&#8217;t been paying attention to the whole anti/pro whaling debate so I don&#8217;t really know what is going on. Though I do reckon there needs to be some form of legislation to ensure the survival of the species. Humankind has already contributed to the endangerment and extinction of many flora and fauna worldwide, it&#8217;ll be sad to see such a unique animal fade away into oblivion because we take our need and wants first.
