Formal was on last night, and I didn&#8217;t go to sleep till 10.30 am! Well I came back 8-ish, and by that stage was feeling very sick (well I think everyone was). It took like 20 minutes to get all the bobby pins out of my hair! It still feels yuck from all the hair spray stuff. Then had a shower, packed some stuff, then watched some tv before deciding it was good to go to bed. To check out formal picks go [here](http://www.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~sleung/pics/rghs). Also go [here](http://groups.msn.com/muckup) too. Anyways gotta run&#8230; I&#8217;m going to Noosa tomorrow. Be back next Friday, but may not be on for a while, as I have lots of phone calls to make. Things are working out just nicely &#8211; for the time being that is.
