Hmm, well theres a bit to fill in since Thursday. Big Day Out, was definatley one BIG DAY OUT! Muse rocked&#8230; I&#8217;d say probably rate in the top 3 bands I&#8217;ve seen (the other two being RBF and TLE). Queued up with Sal for like 2 hours to get a decent spot in the D barrier! But it was worth it&#8230; Metallica were crazy (the crowd anyway), quite glad wasn&#8217;t in the mosh then, &#8216;cos I think it would&#8217;ve been just a bit to hectic and crazy for me. Storm was nice&#8230; funny watching people jump the barrier and dodge the security guards to get into the D.

Today went to Maq with Sal. Got her BDO photos developed (I have a copy too&#8230; woot! &#8211; thanks heaps ðŸ™‚ ), and watched &#8216;Along Came Polly&#8217; &#8217;twas a pretty good movie, funny&#8230; though like most movies, the endings were stupid. Man, Ben Stiller is funny&#8230; Oh also bought 2 CDs&#8230; spent time contemplating&#8230; in HMV they has U2 Best of&#8230; for $14.95 but I only like a few U2 songs&#8230; in Grace Bros it was damn $44.95! >.
