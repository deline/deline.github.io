So i watched T.A.R. last night, and the hippies are so funny. They remind me of the movie Dude Where&#8217;s My Car? for some reason. Best line last night was from Tyler when carrying the swordfish:

 _It actually feels good after awhile. Like an ice pack&#8230;._

that made me laugh big time for some reason.
