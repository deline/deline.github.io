Just heard some music from [Devin Davis](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:1fkzu3yaan8k). It is actually pretty good. I&#8217;d definatley buy the CD, hopefully JB-HIFI will stock it, otherwise I&#8217;ll need to buy it online. Now I&#8217;m in a mood to listen to Badly Drawn Boy cd&#8217;s&#8230;
