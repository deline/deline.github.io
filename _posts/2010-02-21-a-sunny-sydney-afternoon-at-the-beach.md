excerpt: |
  Headed over to Freshwater this afternoon with two of my friends for an afternoon at the beach. Nice sunny Sydney summer weather that wasn't too hot made for a great day. And my first trip to the beach this summer - I didn't count swimming in Asia as that's not quite the same as a Sydney summer.
  
  There's something about Sydney I reckon... everytime I come back from holidays I'm glad to be home. I'm not really sure why that is exactly. I love the climate - not too hot/cold (except maybe those crazy 40 degree days!), water is pretty much within easy reach - makes for a nice sunset view coming over the bridges on the way home, parks to cycle through and enjoy and the lifestyle.
  
  I haven't really live in another country for an extended period of time, but I reckon Sydney is somewhere I'll always enjoy returning too.
