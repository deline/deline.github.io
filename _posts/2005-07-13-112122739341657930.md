Professional web developers who don&#8217;t test in Mozilla (i.e. Firefox)?!? Hard to believe but yes its true. Ironically, Firefox is on the rise as the world states it&#8217;s dislike for pop up ads and non tabbed browsing (\*sarcasm\*). But seriosuly, Firefox is on the rise and I&#8217;m glad of that. More people should [spread Firefox](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/). It&#8217;s probably one of the best software changes I&#8217;ve made &#8211; along with moving to Thunderbird of course. But back to the core of the post&#8230; test stuff in Firefox/Mozilla. If it works it&#8217;ll work elsewhere (well most of the time it will). Now if anyone else knows of open source programs that are brilliant give me an email about them&#8230;
