Fill in the &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; with whatever curse you want. I tried to upgrade the K2 theme last night (really more like early this morning!), and for the most part it worked. And the upgraded theme was actually better&#8230; except that the stupid sidebars module would not work, and at 12 something at night, I could not bother tinkering with the code&#8230; I tried a hack of the code which worked, but I didn&#8217;t like it, &#8216;cos I had to inverse the if statement, which annoyed me. So mass attempts later, I went back to the old K2 and modified some of the styles&#8230; going to bed at closer to 2am than 1am.

Only to have my dad wake me up a bit after 6am as we are supposed to pick mum up from the airport. Except I found out late last night that the flight got delayed by an hour&#8230;. Surprise surprise this morning, it turns out it ended up getting delayed 4+ hours, so here I am awake at 7 something am and we won&#8217;t have to leave till at least 10am at the earliest! Bummer&#8230; (to the sleep thing)
