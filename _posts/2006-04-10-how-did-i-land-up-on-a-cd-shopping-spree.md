during my lunch break?!? A simple walk up to HMV to see if they had a cd (which I knew that 99% wouldn&#8217;t, but I couldn&#8217;t be bothered walking up to JB Hi-Fi) and I ended up with the following &#8211; none of which were on my list to start of with:

I have to say that The Life Pursuit album is awesome. I love the song For the Price of a Cup of Tea. Now I&#8217;m wishing I bought tickets to see Belle & Sebastian though üôÅ

Haven&#8217;t got around to listening to the other CDs yet&#8230;
