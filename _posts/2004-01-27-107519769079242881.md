Well it was back to work today, though I guess I can&#8217;t really say that, because I was working off/on during the holidays. But yeah, was a pretty okay day. My car needs its rego done&#8230; earliest they can do it is Friday and if I drop it in the morning (early), I don&#8217;t get it back till like noon! So looks like I&#8217;ll be catching the bus on Friday&#8230; crappy eh? Have to remind myself to ring dad to pick the car up in the afternoon &#8216;cos I may not get home in time to pick it up. Oh last night saw &#8216;Finding Nemo&#8217;. Was a pretty good movie. Bumped into Megan at the end&#8230; big coincidence, meant I didn&#8217;t have to drop buy today to drop of tickets&#8230; so yep cruise in 2 weeks!!! Got to go back and finish this sheeto thingo off before tomorrow&#8230;
