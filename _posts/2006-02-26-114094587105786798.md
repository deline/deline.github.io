Well I right royally f$%#ed up my lappie tonight. So I went to install this thingo I d/l from the net, and just my luck it turns out to be this bug riddled software which pretty much ruins my Windows system files, such that I can&#8217;t even start up properly. I couldn&#8217;t really care less about that part but more about rescuing my emails that date back years and the photos that Em had sent me from Canada. Lucky I found a utility which allowed me to retrieve them from the DOS environment after which I restored my partition from an image I&#8217;d made back in Jan. But all is good now I think&#8230;
