I woke up at 4am today to go out to The Gap at Watson&#8217;s Bay to take pictures of the sun rising. Got back around 6:40am. I&#8217;m running the pictures back to my computer right now. It was pretty, peaceful and tranquil that early in the morning. There&#8217;s no sound, no traffic, just fresh air. I&#8217;m contemplating whether going for my exercise walk/jog this morning, but I think I might go this afternoon instead, as I&#8217;m dressed in jeans right now, and can&#8217;t be bothered changing. Ahh my photos have finished copying, so I shall get going so I can check them out. Bye
