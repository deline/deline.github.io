At uni waiting till 2 for meeting. Had OOP labs today, was lab exam week. Mmm stressful on both parts which I was surprised. This weekend possibly crazy. Need to get a new PSU for my other comp &#8211; it&#8217;s kind of died&#8230; üôÅ Ahh next weekend I have to drive out to Rosehill some schools expo thingo&#8230; gotta give some ppls a lift out there. Cools is something to do.

Sunday is mother&#8217;s day (I think?) should I buy anything? Have I ever bought anything??? I don&#8217;t really/actually remember. I gotta rememeber to visit grandma this weekend. Didn&#8217;t go last week. I thought id be able to go midweek once uni went back, but it hasn&#8217;t happened. My weeks are jam packed full pretty much.

Back home now&#8230; I saved my post as a draft so I could finish it later. I&#8217;ve had a craving for peanut butter as of yesterday&#8230; dunno why&#8230; don&#8217;t really eat it and haven&#8217;t eaten it in at least a year or more&#8230; weird!

I gotta question&#8230; I&#8217;m apparently getting super, but I didn&#8217;t even know it&#8230; how am I meant to know where it is going? lol, it&#8217;ll probably turn out to be money I forget I ever had stashed away. It&#8217;s with [UniSuper](http://www.unisuper.com.au/) apparently.
