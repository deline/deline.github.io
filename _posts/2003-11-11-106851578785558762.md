Well one exam is down and just two more to go. On another note, the next few weeks/months may be a bit turbulent. Basically my grandmother&#8217;s been diagnosed with cancer (I don&#8217;t know the whole story just yet)&#8230; anyways the only option is to operate, but no decision is made yet. Either way it goes (surgery or not) it&#8217;s gonna be pretty tough, because of her age. Theres advantages and disadvantages to both sides&#8230;. guess will have to wait and see what happens next week back at the hospital. And I guess there is an end to everything, but&#8230;. yeah&#8230;&#8230;
