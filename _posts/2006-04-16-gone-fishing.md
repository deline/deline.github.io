So on this fine Easter Sunday morning I was up at the crazy time of 6:15am to go fishing. Ended up under The Spit Bridge near Seaforth. 15 minutes there and I&#8217;d landed two fish&#8230; except they were baby snapper and way undersized so they got to live another day. Have to remind myself though next time I should wear a beanie, scarf, gloves and more clothes as it was absolutely freezing cold!
