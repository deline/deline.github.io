So there is on power coming back for at least a few hours. Use to happen a bit a few years back but this has been the first in ages. It kind of killed the tv viewing. And increased the temperature due to the candle lighting. I think i shall just go to sleep. Which was kind of happening until the electricity going off woke me up of my half asleep state.
