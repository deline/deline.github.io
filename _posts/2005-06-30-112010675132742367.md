It&#8217;s raining, it&#8217;s pouring; but the old man ain&#8217;t snoring&#8230; Went to the city today, my mail was not at the interface &#8211; some rang me from uni yesterday to find out where to leave my mail. If this is the mail I think it is I&#8217;ve been looking for it for ages&#8230; Anyways after that went up towards the Pitt St side of the CBD. So much rain and wind = umbrellas copping a battering. But it&#8217;s good. It makes a change from the pretty calm winter we&#8217;ve had, and after all the more rain the better.

Yesterday caught up with a friend ate pizza and watched [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/). It&#8217;s an interesting movie. The video was classed as a comedy at the video store, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d call it a comedy. It&#8217;s more like one of those films which you have to think, yet are great in some uncanny way &#8211; think Traffic or 21 Grams.
