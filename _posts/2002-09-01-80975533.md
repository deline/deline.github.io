Haha&#8230; and he said I was bad and he would be better&#8230; hehe shouldn&#8217;t overestimate. Hehe my brother went driving today for the first time, and drove up the kerb poppingthe tyre. Best part was he was doing 60 in a 50 zone. Mentioned somthing about being hard to drive slow&#8230;. some excuse IMO mum and dad when they took me had to tell me to drive faster&#8230; haha well you get what you give I s&#8217;pose so he should&#8217;ve thought when he knocked me for my lack of driving&#8230;.. and general badness at it.
  
Eek&#8230;..if i was him i wouldn&#8217;t be laughing&#8230; money ain&#8217;t grow on trees and psycho drivers should drive&#8230; hmm that might explain why I can&#8217;t be bothred to learn drive&#8230;&#8230;.. must be in the genes&#8230;. bad driver gene&#8230;. i wonder if such exists&#8230;..
