Mmm well last night watched [What A Girl Wants](http://www2.warnerbros.com/whatagirlwants/). &#8216;Twas a teen movie but actually watchable and light hearted. Funny how Colin Firth is always seems to be playing some high aristocratic person (these days anyway). Moral of the story, be true to who you are and don&#8217;t let anyone change you/make you do anything you don&#8217;t want&#8230;
