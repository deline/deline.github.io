Mmm going to the movies tonight in a few hours, Emily&#8217;s picking me up a little after 8. Going to see the Mona Lisa Smile. Went to the Fish Market&#8217;s this morning to get the bait. Got some pilchard and baby squid. In other news, I&#8217;ve been spending today taking learning C in a crash course sort of way. It&#8217;s actually making some sense. Finally installed a compiler so I&#8217;ve been practising what I&#8217;ve read in forms of my own little exercises/missions, to better grasp it. It&#8217;s very similar to Java in ways, minus a few quirks it has which I think I can cope/deal with (hopefully). Anyway going to have a shower before eating dinner&#8230;&#8230;.. so laters
