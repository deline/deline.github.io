After the realisation that the saying &#8216;if it ain&#8217;t broke don&#8217;t fix it&#8217; holds true, here is my real post for the what seems like ages. In the time that has gone past, I&#8217;ve become one year older&#8230; yes I&#8217;m the ripe old age of 22 now. It&#8217;s kind of weird, I use to feel like I was getting older, but now that I&#8217;m working I feel awfully young. Most people are at least 2-3 years older than me, and that is in the minority. Is it wrong for me to not want to &#8216;grow up&#8217; per say? I dunno, I think I&#8217;ve still got a while to work out what I really want to do, if I ever do.

Oh but for dinner we went to this restaurant in North Ryde which seriously had the best Malaysian food. I was a bit skeptical at first, because it was in the suburbs and in a very very random location. Turns out it&#8217;s this new place, and I give it the thumbs up&#8230; you&#8217;ll be hard pressed to find a place with as authentic a taste.

On that very same day (this isn&#8217;t in chronological order btw), I bought a [new phone](http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=au&lc=en&ver=4000&template=pp1_loader&php=php1_10407&zone=pp&lm=pp1&pid=10407)&#8230; it&#8217;s an awfully long story, but basically how phone companies recoup costs now is in part due through their minimum spends. So a handset which may cost you $X/month requires you to go on a rate plan that has a minium spend of $Y/month. Thus your total cost is really $(X + Y). But because I hold one of the old/original 3 accounts, I can get a new phone really really cheap, because I don&#8217;t have to go on a rate plan, so i really only pay $X/month. Even better is that these original accounts don&#8217;t have any minimum spends and have cheaper rates, because when they were starting out, everything was cheaper in order for them to acquire market share. The downside is if I ever move carriers then decide to move back to 3 I&#8217;ll be put on one of their new plans, unless I take out a new number with the new carrier which i don&#8217;t want to do. Oh and did I mention people are selling these &#8216;original&#8217; accounts for $150 &#8211; $200?!? Oh lol and I got the phone unlocked as well&#8230;
