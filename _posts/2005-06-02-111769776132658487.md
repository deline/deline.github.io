[BBC NEWS | Entertainment | Music | New Coldplay album leaked to net](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4600159.stm) But like the article says it is pretty impressive it got so far without being leaked. Indeed the Oasis album is all over the Internet. That said, I may have heard both of them already, but I am definatley going out to buy them on the 6th (only 4 more days!)&#8230;

I guess in regards to the debate that _The music industry has battled internet &#8220;pirates&#8221; in recent years, arguing that fans are less likely to buy the CD if they have already downloaded the album for free_ its a bit of a conflict area. I will more than happily buy the album even if I have heard a downloaded version. My reasons for such are great and varied, but to me, there&#8217;s nothing like owning the original, and also bands deserve to get the recognition for all the work, time and effort that they put in to produce a such quality product/output (can&#8217;t think of the word I want to use). So to all&#8230;. 6th of June, hit the record stores&#8230;
