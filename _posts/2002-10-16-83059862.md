Have you ever imagined being an ant? What would it be like to be that small? What is it like when a human foot comes stomping down into your path? Sounds like a dangerous life IMO.
  
At the mo, for some strange reason I like one of the OC Supertones songs&#8230;. but this one is a pretty religious one I must say. Yeah the Supertones are a religious kind of ska band, but their music is actually pretty good. More the stuff I&#8217;m into I think. Sorta upbeat good stuff. I should go to sleep now&#8230; but I need a cold drink first. I didn&#8217;t sleep much last night. I went to bed late-ish&#8230; and couldn&#8217;t sleep and woke up before 6 as I thought it was 7 something. Cordial&#8230;&#8230;. orange cordial at 11.35pm! with ice&#8230;lots of ice&#8230;.. ahh refreshing&#8230;&#8230;.. damn i been doing too much Maths papers&#8230;
