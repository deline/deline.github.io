excerpt: "So made it to McCarran Airport checked in and all. Got to security screening and yay I'm marked SSSS. Which meant I had to get the special screening. Body pat down, bag searched (even though x-rayed), shoes checked and swabbed for stuff (I'm guessing explosives?). Will be interesting to see if I get checked over to NY. If so it probably means my name s similar to one on the watch list. Or I just have an really odd name to the Americans."

So made it to McCarran Airport checked in and all. Got to security screening and yay I&#8217;m marked SSSS. Which meant I had to get the special screening. Body pat down, bag searched (even though x-rayed), shoes checked and swabbed for stuff (I&#8217;m guessing explosives?). Will be interesting to see if I get checked over to NY. If so it probably means my name s similar to one on the watch list. Or I just have an really odd name to the Americans.
