Wow it&#8217;s Tuesday already, almost Wednesday infact. Well I had a quiet weekend, as I had the excitement of Blink 182 coming up, but alow and behold, it got rescheduled!!! Travis the drummer broke his foot and they all flew back to America. Good crap I say. Good &#8216;cos its supposed to be back on in July, which is the holidays, crap &#8216;cos its a few months away&#8230; This is probably the first and last time I&#8217;ll see them, as their kind of teen-ish. And I&#8217;m only going in the hope that they play old stuff. Plus it&#8217;ll probably be a good atmosphere &#8216;cos kiddies make shows a lot more hypo and fun. So that was my downer for the week. Oh yeah I was right, in regards to my (now ages ago) post regarding something. Mmm yeah I&#8217;m going swimming again tomorrow. 20 laps = 1KM&#8230; woot, please no tiredness for the rest of the day though till I get home. Anyways I&#8217;m off to brush my teeth and go to sleep&#8230; Adios&#8230;
