Okay, so I&#8217;m going to do a music plug here, but I really love the music that get&#8217;s played on GA, it&#8217;s mainly a mix of alternative stuff, but the great thing is it plays heaps of smaller less unknown bands/artists (well in this part of the woods anyway). One artist I&#8217;ve got playing a fair bit is [Mike Doughty](http://www.mikedoughty.com/). If you get the chance listen to I Hear The Bells.
