American TV season has started up again and I&#8217;m in TV and music heaven as they kind of somewhat go together. Now you&#8217;ve probably all heard me rave about Snow Patrol for ages&#8230; but as of late they&#8217;ve sold out&#8230; Not that selling out is a bad thing, but the [use is really somewhat getting out of hand](http://www.eonline.com/Insider/Boards/thread.jspa?threadID=34581&tstart=0). Still I reckon it is somewhat awesome to hear them on big hit tv shows, considering they were previously somewhat nobodies&#8230; Just in the last 2 weeks they&#8217;ve been played on both Grey&#8217;s (again for the 3rd time!) and Jericho&#8230;.

Speaking of Jericho, after I watched the first episode I mentioned to a mate it was a lot like Lost, and woah behold I read this article that that&#8217;s what others have been saying&#8230; it&#8217;s Lost without the island and plane crash really. Oh and Ugly Betty turns out I&#8217;m also not the only one who reckons it&#8217;s like The Devil Wears Prada&#8230; We&#8217;ll see if those two shows survive it past their first season&#8230;.

Other than that&#8230;. apparently the Big Day Out line up comes out this Wednesday???&#8230;..
