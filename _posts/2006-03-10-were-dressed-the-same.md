So in my lunch break today I caught up with Justin for lunch. I was on the phone at the time when he rocked up, so once I finished the call he&#8217;s like &#8216;we&#8217;re dressed the same&#8217;&#8230; and I&#8217;m like &#8216;what?&#8217;&#8230; and then he points it out&#8230; we were BOTH wearing: brown coloured shoes, drak blue jeans, a polo shirt and to top it off, even our glasses frames were the exact same colour and both half/top rims only.
