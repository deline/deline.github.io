Eeek just took my last dose of Dukoral, and it was like worst than the first time. I only just managed to finish the glass and now I feel really sick because it tasted horrible. Yuk. But it&#8217;s done now, so I suppose that&#8217;s the good thing. Oh an a random side note, I just found out that it actually is cold in Delhi in December&#8230;. like 15 degrees or so&#8230; oops.
