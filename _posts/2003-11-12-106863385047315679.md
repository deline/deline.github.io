The other day (or rather on the weekend, so really a delayed post) I bought the newish (well a few month old) Muse album, Absolution&#8230;. Is interesting&#8230; there older stuff was more rockish, but this is interesting&#8230;. a bit darker though&#8230; but I like the instrumental parts mostly&#8230; piano parts are good. Anyway need to go back to OOD study. Laters&#8230;
