excerpt: |
  So its only been a month since coming back from holidays yet it feels so long ago. There's been a bit happening in my life at the moment, but everything's all good.

  Without delving too much into it though, the main change in my life is that I'm starting a job at a different organisation in a few weeks. Whilst it will be sad to leave where I'm at now I am quite excited and looking forward to the new role. It's going to bring a new set of challenges, and I'm sure there is going to be many fun and challenging experiences along the way.
