Big Day Out tomorrow! Can&#8217;t wait. Hope its good weather, sunny with a slight breeze and hopefully no thunderstorms, though I doubt the latter will come true, especially if the weather is like today and yesterday. Today spent the day photocopying. Photocopiers are EVIL WHEN THEY DO NOT WORK is all I can say. Otherwise a pretty okay day, brought my lappy so I got some work done at the same time.
