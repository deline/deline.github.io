So I&#8217;m coming home from work today on the bus, and being daylight saving summer soccer is on. What&#8217;s hilarious is the two women on the bus who are trying to madly change into their soccer gear whilst not flashing to the rest of the passengers. You kind of had to be there (or rather seated next to them)&#8230;

Oh yeah The Living End are doing an instore tomorrow at HMV Pitt Street Mall. Now depending on how my day starts (i.e. morning traffic), I hopefully will finish of a bit earlier and make my way down there&#8230;
