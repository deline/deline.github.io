Well picked up my PostSecret book today and it is awesome&#8230; best buy in a while. Some good ones:

  * I gave my vegetarian sister a meal with beef
  * sometimes i put coins into other peoples parking meters
  * I got a parking citation and so did the car next to me. I replaced the ticket on the car next to me with mine. My ticket got paid. And the one I took? I mailed it to PostSecret.
  * I tell everyone I&#8217;m allergic to cucumbers. I&#8217;m Not. But now I&#8217;m scared to eat them. Because I&#8217;ve even told myself.
  * I stole valium from my epileptic dog

Love it&#8230;
