There&#8217;s a [State of Emergency](http://www.thelivingend.com/2006/)&#8230; bought the new CD in my lunch break today. But meh if I&#8217;d walked up to the Galeries Victoria I could&#8217;ve got it cheap at JB Hi-Fi&#8230; oh well. This album is definitely better than Modern Artillery as it&#8217;s back to the well loved sounds/tunes of the self titled debut album and Roll On, with an even more refined sound to it all.
