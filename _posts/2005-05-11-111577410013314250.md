Just a quick (well sorta post), before I pack my stuff grab a cappuccino and go to work. Anyways this first bit relates back to yesterday. Hilarious really&#8230; well we had a PP&E lab, and these people managed to break equipment 3 times. The first time, as the first breakage was being cleaned up they managed to break another&#8230; then later on another&#8230; In my whole time in highschool (which was a while ago), I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen more than 1 or 2 items get broken!

Anyway what do you reckon, I have this assessment centre thingo where theres going to be an interview, team activities, tests etc and I don&#8217;t know whether to dress smart casual or formal business attire as it didn&#8217;t provide any hints. I&#8217;m thinking to go for the safe option which is formal&#8230; what do you reckon?
