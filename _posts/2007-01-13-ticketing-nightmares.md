So i thought i had it all sorted. But then late last night it would show my booking number but not retrieve it. So i went into work early today and it took like an hour to sort out. Turns out some crazy stuff happened. Had to ring the bank to check if the transaction went through cos the airline couldn&#8217;t tell. Made worse cos i wasn&#8217;t the credit card holder. They usually let you pick it up at the airport with the credit card holder present but it turned out because some of the airports don&#8217;t do e-tickets i had to get paper ones. Which ment my dad had to come in to the city. I owe my dad bigtime for coming in today &#8211; thanks dad!
  
But at least thats all sorted now so i can be all calm again after the craziness it was.
