Went to Maq for lunch today with Sal and Fi &#8211; was good. Then trekked to Alexandria to see Sal&#8217;s bro&#8217;s girlfriend and buy a white shirt which are gonna paint/stencil for Big Day Out. Want to go swimming tomorrow, but damn rain looks like if I want to it&#8217;ll have to be an indoor pool which kinda sucks &#8211; chlorine + closed spaces = yuk!!! Maybe, hopefully on Sunday it will be sunny. Other than that, does anyone know where I can get fabric paint? Grr need to clean room, can&#8217;t find matching bed sheet&#8230; dammit
