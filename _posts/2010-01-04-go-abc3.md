excerpt: |
  Flicked through the TV Guide this evening and was somewhat surprised that ABC3 was re-airing Heartbreak High, one of the better Aussie TV shows of all times. Ironically (or coincidentally?) most of the better Aussie shows seem to have the same cast/crew combo working on them.. Wildside in the mid/late 90's... to today where you've probably got the Underbelly series on Nine.
  
  So in a break from my usual Monday night workings, I flicked my TV to ABC3 and was even more surprised when they were showing Season 1... (which Ten originally had the rights too)... Looks like I may be having a 30 min slot with my TV each night seeing I haven't actually watched much of the earlier seasons...
