Well, Stereophonics last night kicked. Yeah it was a bit boring waiting around till they came on (I went alone), but well worth it. One of the best performances I&#8217;ve seen and I would definatley see them again. But the music was \*very\* loud. Like it took the ages for my ears to adjust. In fact for the first band, I would say I had a headache because of the loudness of it all.
