Well okay other people do have the Bank Holiday off as well, but it doesn&#8217;t really help when the people you know don&#8217;t have it off. So I was kind of thinking today was going to be a somewhat lazy day in watching dvds and tv on my lonesome. Turns out not quite&#8230; rather I spent half my day driving all around Sydney. Not that that was a bad thing. My journey for today kind of involved Putney > Denistone > Chester Hilll > Putney > Eastwood > North Ryde > Putney&#8230; beat that a half day crazy road trip. In the midst of my travels the Eastwood stop involved dropping some old uni stuff off to a mate. I haven&#8217;t been to Eastwood in ages&#8230; I remember years back when it was nothing like it is now. Not that it&#8217;s current prescence is good or bad&#8230;. just that alot happens in 10+ years doesn it? I wonder what I&#8217;ll be doing in 10 years?
