So the decision has been made to make the foray into the crazy realms of the Sydney real estate market, the objective to find a place to live in. So with that means a lot of spare time surfing domain.com.au and weekends spent looking at &#8216;open for inspections&#8217;. Highlights for this week:

  * House going under contract the night before were to check it out üôÅ
  * Number 1&#8217;s still left in the kids potty in the bathroom
  * House&#8217;s that were in a terrible state &#8211; carpet that was frayed and separated, walls that were separating, paint jobs that looked like the person wasn&#8217;t even trying (it looked like outdoor paint too!)

Let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s easily noticeable whether a property being sold is a rental or an owner occupied&#8230;
