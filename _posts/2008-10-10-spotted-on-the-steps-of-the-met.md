  <i>Spotted on the steps of the Met... Deline happy that she is still on holidays. Little does she know that there is just only over 2 weeks left before the return home.</i>

  Okay that probably doesn't make much sense to many readers, but Em and Trish you probably will get it. They had construction on the steps though. I think there was a reference to that in the first ep of this season - will have to re-watch when I get home...

  Anyways, am in NYC now. For the rundown of the flight across read scroll down to below the -----. For a insight into it, it was written during a 5 hour wait at the airport... an hour of which consisted of sitting on the plane!.

  Arriving a little later than expected once the bags were dropped it was off out and about. Being somewhat addicted to GG a walk past the 'Palace' was required, and since it was pretty much almost round the corner the first stop (not really in the Upper East Side). After that a hot dog on the way to the Rockefeller Center to go to Top of the Rock which is an observation deck at the top. There are 3 levels and it gives you views out over all of Manhatten. Was pretty cool to look out at night.

  Next was the Apple Store at 5th avenue then on to Times Square... Times Square had lots of flashy signs. Not sure if Vegas copied Times Square or Times Square copied Vegas. Unfortunately no Naked Cowboy was present. Then a stroll back to the hotel.

  This morning was going to head up the Empire State but it was too hazy/foggy so decided to try tomorrow for a better view. So headed up towards Central Park for a walk around which was quite nice then checked out shops on 5th avenue.

  Back at the hotel now for a bit of a rest but heading back out to Broadway/Times Square in the evening as watching the Lion King tonight.

  So this is being typed from SF airport to be posted later. We're having a TAR moment... it's just on 8am have been at the airport since 4 something and the flight was meant to leave at 7:20am. If not for a faulty air conditioning part. And there was no definite answer for like more than an hour... instead something like 'We don't know if it is cancelled or is just delayed yet. There is a part at LA or maybe another plane but no decision.'. Which isn't actually helpful. So after a bit of waiting jumped in the customer service line as well as trying to phone United. Except the line was long and the phone service was all automated and didn't like me.

  In the meantime there's 'a plane has arrived from LA, we have to check if the part is on it...' Hmmm how hard is it to know if they packed the part or not? Anyway, eventually it was confirmed, they were fixing it, and we're now leaving at 9:15am. Ironically everyone tried to book onto the next JFK flight which is full and it is leaving pretty much at the same time as us now.

  Yay to flight delays... meh and they don't serve food domestically here in the US even when the flight is just short of 6 hours.
