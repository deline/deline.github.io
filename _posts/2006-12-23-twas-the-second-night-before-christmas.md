And what better way to spend it than hanging with your friends? Other than that it&#8217;s the usual silly season which this year is being held at my house. I think I&#8217;m somewhat averse to the whole festive season. Having been away the last 2 has quite possibly made me the grinch who does not get overly excited at bright happy flashing christmas lights. Still there&#8217;s always next year to work on being less cynical when it comes to lights&#8230; (I&#8217;m working on it&#8230;)

This 4 day break is like wonder for me&#8230; well not literally. It&#8217;s like my longest non-working period since like Feb. Yep I&#8217;m working those 3 days in between. Don&#8217;t really mind it though. There&#8217;s work to do and it&#8217;ll be quiet so less interruptions/distractions/etc. That said, I do miss being a uni student&#8230; if I was still one&#8230; who knows where I would&#8217;ve been now&#8230; probably some other random country&#8230;
