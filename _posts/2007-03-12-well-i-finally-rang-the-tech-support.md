Due to the crappy weekend of constant dropouts of the modem. Looks like a techie is coming out next week to have a look. Hope they actually find something in the line from the pole to the house and can fix it&#8230; theres only so many times one can handle going through the cycle of:

  * power off
  * unscrew coax
  * power on
  * screw coax back on
  * watch flashing lights
