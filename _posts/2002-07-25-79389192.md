Hmm, I&#8217;ve got all my marks back for SDD, IPT, ITV now. They&#8217;re okay, IPT is pretty good. Would&#8217;ve liked to do better in all 3, but I&#8217;m pretty cool with what I got. Where I lost all marks in all three was where I expected to anyway, so it wasn&#8217;t too much of a shock. At least I know the areas I need to improve on&#8230;well I&#8217;ve started reading this book.
  
Totally of the topic of school, I&#8217;ve really gotta out some sort of thing like a disclaimer before people come view my blog, because this is my place to rant and rave..and one day I might write something which may offend people, so I better do it. Sorta along the lines of &#8216;This is my own little space to rant and rave, stuff I say here is what&#8217;s in my mind at the time, so don&#8217;t take it personally. If you don&#8217;t like it, you can click a link and surf on away..&#8217; Hmm&#8230;. I wonder if that&#8217;s too rude? That then brings up the whole question of why I&#8217;m writing here then. Maybe because it&#8217;s something different, anyway it&#8217;s a blog&#8230;people are meant to read it. But my inner deepest thoughts won&#8217;t go here because that&#8217;s just going to far. Gotta draw the line..somewhere I s&#8217;pose. Bleh&#8230; I think to much and it&#8217;s annoying&#8230;.
