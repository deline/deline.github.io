Well I just got back from seeing &#8216;Bowling For Columbine&#8217;. It was good, it&#8217;s so strange how American&#8217;s can just buy guns and ammunition so easily. Scary in a way if you think about it.

Also today I got a letter regarding the school assembly&#8230; and damn it clashes with IT camp! So, so much for the assembly hey? I would&#8217;ve wanted to go to the assembly, just to see people one last time, plus it would&#8217;ve been sorta cool. But eh, not everything works out in life, and you just gotta accept what happens. Anyways I&#8217;m going for a run now.. so laters
