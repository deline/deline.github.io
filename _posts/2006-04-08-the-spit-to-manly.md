Spent today walking The Spit to Manly track. We actually thought it would be this fairly surbanised track&#8230; turned out it wasn&#8217;t. It was actually through the middle of Sydney Harbour National Park and there were sandstone stairs/steps bush to climb up/over/around. It was a nice walk &#8211; don&#8217;t think too many people were doing the whole 10KM track as we only started seeing lots of people once we were nearing the end of the walk, who we&#8217;re possibly walking up to Dobroyd Head. Took the camera, so have got a few [photos up](http://delineneo.com/photos/thumbnails.php?album=14).
