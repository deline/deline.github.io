Well this evening went to see [Pride and Prejudice](http://www.prideandprejudicemovie.net/home.html) with friends. The interesting point of the night, was when we were buying tickets, because we got upgraded to Gold Class for free. $11.20 for reclining chairs, free popcorn and free soft drink. Score. We came to the assumption this was because of either:
  
a) The cinema is trying to promote Gold Class by giving &#8216;target&#8217; people a free taste of Gold Class in the hope they tell their friends
  
b) They had to give away upgrades for free so the people employed in the Gold Class section actually had work to do.

Nonetheless, it was really nice and definatley better than Hoyt&#8217;s La Premiere. For starters, drinks are served in glasses not plastic cups and the staff bring the drinks/popcorn out for you. If your wondering which cinema it is we went to, it&#8217;s [Reading Cinemas](http://www.readingcinemas.com.au/) at Rhodes.
