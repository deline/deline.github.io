I don&#8217;t usually post work related stuff here, but today i was on this course, and I actually liked it. It was on communication skills, but a fair bit of it was theories, quizzes etc on communication/learning styles etc. It was kind of like this subject I did at uni last year which I really enjoyed. The interesting part of it all was it actually semi rekindled the thought in me of whether I&#8217;m doing the right thing. Unlike everyone else who scored &#8216;people&#8217; in their top 2 preferences (or were evenly spread amongst all) I scored highly in the process and idea areas with a measly 3 for people (\*wonders how I got a job&#8230;\*). And apparently I&#8217;m a theorist. Which is nothing awfully new, but it does make me wonder yet again if I should (and would be better) of at uni chasing those theories around &#8211; which in some ways I probably would be. It&#8217;s food for thought really&#8230;
