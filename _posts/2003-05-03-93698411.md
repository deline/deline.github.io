Watched a friend play soccer today down at Meadowbank. Haven&#8217;t watched people play soccer in person since I stopped playing about 3 years ago, so it was pretty good. In other stuff I&#8217;ve changed my mind again and decided I do need a laptop, because of all this stuff I have to download for uni, so if I get a lappy I can d/l it from uni then bring it home. &#8216;Cos if I get it from my uni account from home, I&#8217;m using up my monthly downloads.
  
Hmm I also think I&#8217;m getting RSI in my left shoulder again. I think that was the shoulder I buggered up last time. Oh well. Anyways gtg, ICC to work on and OOP. Freaking 1 more line for OOP and I&#8217;ll be done, but it aint seem to be working. Laterz&#8230;
