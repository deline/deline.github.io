Mmm I&#8217;ve had a hiatus. Partly because I&#8217;m not in a mood to blog, and also &#8216;cos the FTP has been weird hence not seeing any updated posts. So this will be my last go before I head of tomorrow.Oh yeah short post Homebake review. &#8216;Twas good. Grinspoon were good and so were Missy Higgins and Machine Gun Fellatio&#8230;

Anyways I&#8217;m off see you all next year. Have a good Christmas and New Year. Maybe I&#8217;ll try and post or something from overseas. We&#8217;ll see. I have to get on the net at least once. Re-enrolments and everything&#8230;
