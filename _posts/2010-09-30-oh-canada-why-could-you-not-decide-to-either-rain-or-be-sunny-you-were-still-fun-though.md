title: Oh Canada, why could you not decide to either rain or be sunny (you were still fun though)

excerpt: |
  So crossed the border to Canada for a couple of days to see Niagara Falls. Crossing was easy enough, town car pick up at Buffalo Airport for the 45 min drive to the border. A few questions from border control and the passport was stamped. As the title goes though, the weather was a bit dismal for the 2 days, the first day more or less drizzling with a couple of rain periods. So the falls on that day looked quite different with dark clouds and stacks of mist. The next day started somewhat similar but the sun gods did come good in the middle of the day with blue sky appearing. And in this window you could see the falls looked like they look in pictures. Pretty cool all that water making its way over the edge! Did the falls touristy things like Maid of the Mist, Behind the Falls and the Whirlpool Aero Car. Got some videos but can't upload them as they're recorded in HD and are huge in size!

  Today crossed back into the American side of the falls (Niagara Falls consists of 3 waterfalls, 2 of which are on the US side, and one on the Canadian). Walked around through Niagara State Park looking at the falls from the other side then went on the Cave of the Winds trip. And I have to say this was the best touristy thing of them all! You walked these boardwalk things infront of the falls, then if you decided to go up to the 'Hurricane Deck' you're about 6 metres away from the Bridal Veil Falls. Except it feels and looks like you're standing underneath it with the wind and stacks of water landing on top of you. They give you this yellow poncho thing to wear, but I stuck my rain jacket on too and still got wet. As I had the PlaySport with me, managed to capture this fun in video and still.

  Tomorrow afternoon it's back to Buffalo Airport for the flight to NYC...

  Cave of the Winds. That's Bridal Veil Falls on the right side, which you can literally stand underneath on the 'Hurricane Deck'
