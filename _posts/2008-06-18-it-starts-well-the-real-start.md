  Today commenced the braces on for me for the next year or so... I've decided to keep a running blog of it (if I can remember to blog every so often)...
  
  So in order to get a visual perspective of my dental woes... here are some shots for reference... (or for shock horror!)
  
  Teeth before braces:

  Teeth with braces:

  Check out how warped the wire is! Eventually it will become straight and the gaps where the extracted teeth are should close.
