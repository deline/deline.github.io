Since I left high school back in 2002, I haven&#8217;t really coded anything for fun or out of my own curiosity/interest. I was kind of missing it, because that time of my life was when I learnt the most (that&#8217;s what I think/feel anyway). Well, it looks like I&#8217;m getting back into it&#8230; courtesy of [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/). About two months or so ago, [Google started covering Australia](http://blogs.smh.com.au/mashup/archives//004599.html) which is awesome from a web programming perspective.

This development and the slight urge I had to find a techie interest again has kinda spawned [Sydney Parks](http://parks.sydneymashups.com/). It&#8217;s still very, very new, so I haven&#8217;t got many suburbs mapped yet, but it&#8217;s getting there.

Looks like I&#8217;ve jumped onto the mashup bandwagon&#8230;
