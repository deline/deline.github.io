Well just got home from Blink 182 a bit ago. &#8216;Twas good. Heaps better than The Offspring. Lol on the way to pick Emily up me and Trish got lost somewhere in Five Dock. Map reading at night + night time driving = confusion. Eventually found our way to the pickup spot, then met Emily and headed off to the Hordern. Bought a shirt to add to my collection. They didn&#8217;t have many girls shirts left and couldn&#8217;t be bothered doing the men&#8217;s shirt shrinking thingo so got the one that was left.

Other than that, we got home fine, and it&#8217;s probably time to sleep soon.
