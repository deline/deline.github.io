A shitload (&#8216;scuse the language but for want of a better word that one kind of emphasizes things best) has happened since I&#8217;ve last posted, but I won&#8217;t bother posting about it here. Anyways those who read probably know&#8230; so&#8230; other than that&#8230; chocolate flavoured Peanut Butter?!?!

Apparently according to the shelf in Coles yesterday it really is so&#8230; I contemplated buying a jar but it looked wrong&#8230; I mean&#8230; who&#8217;s ever seen dark brown Peanut Butter&#8230; that&#8217;s like Nutella colour! But I think it&#8217;ll win out eventually&#8230; after all if Peanut Butter M&Ms are awesome&#8230;

Anyways going to head out to find myself a 1GB memory card&#8230; and then later on tonight The Killers!

Oh and Happy Australia Day!
