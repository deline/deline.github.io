What do you do when people want to go on holidays, but you don&#8217;t really want to go? Like as in you&#8217;d go if you have to, but you would really prefer to not. I don&#8217;t really want to go away after Christmas. After the exams and Noosa and all, I don&#8217;t think I want to go away again. Yeah it sounds weird, but it&#8217;s sort of how I feel. Anyway it would be weird&#8230;. seeing we haven&#8217;t done anything in years. A week in close proximity&#8230; I dunno&#8230;.. maybe it will be good&#8230; but&#8230;.. who knows&#8230;
  
Anyways I&#8217;m gonna get a drink then go to bed and read the IPT book. Gonna get some help with Maths again tomorrow&#8230;. only a few simple questions this time&#8230; except for maybe that Catholic question. Ooh.. and I need to go on a photocopy spree&#8230;.. gotta get another photocopy card&#8230;&#8230; much more simpler than like scanning 20 pages!
