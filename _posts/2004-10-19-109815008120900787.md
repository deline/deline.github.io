Mmm from yesterday&#8230; guess how much the Hep A / Typhoid vaccine cost??? $117 dollars! ouch says my wallet/pocket. Not working today, &#8216;cos working Wed/Fri instead, so using today to get some work done. Went to Maq first in the morning to claim my money from HCF/Medicare. Grr HCF wouldn&#8217;t let me claim &#8216;cos I&#8217;m not the policy holder. Pain&#8230; now have to get my dad to do it. Then checked how much left to pay for holiday and final payment date.

Oh my health woes go from worse to worser (yes I know thats not a word)&#8230; now I have a sore throat and theres an ulcer (blister???) thingo on the back of my throat/mouth. Sore&#8230; grr..
