My head is spinning and swaying really badly. I woke up at around 3am this morning to get a drink, but when I got out of bed, my head started swaying and I felt like spewing and I fell back into bed. I tried to get up again later, but I couldn&#8217;t make it to the door, cos I thought I was going to faint. This morning it&#8217;s not so scary, but my head is still swaying and I feel really sick, not like as in the flu, but my head is swaying and I feel like throwing up time I start walking. I couldn&#8217;t finish my breakfast either as I started feeling sick. It feels really bad at the moment, I&#8217;ve already taken panadol. But last night was really scary, cos all I felt like doing when I stood up, was fall to the ground, but I couldn&#8217;t let myself do that.
