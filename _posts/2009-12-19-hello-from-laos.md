excerpt: |
  In Laos at internet cafe. Isn't really free wi-fi here so will not be posting as much the next few weeks. Managed to book overnight bus to 4000 islands so leaving for there tonight.

  Seen a few sights in Vientiane. It's a rather laid back town. Barely any cars (let alone any horning), and everything's just rather peaceful and quiet.

  Till next time...
