_Well I think the time has come

to tell you how I feel about everything

thats been just on my mind since the day we crossed

the line into the street like fantasy

&#8216;cos I&#8217;ve put my heart into the last three years of wondering

what I should do

should I get a second training

What I thought I knew

your promises don&#8217;t help to make it easier

&#8216;cos the last thing that I need is somebody like you to push me around and tell me what to do

I know theres a time and a place when you can call the shots but it&#8217;s not here_

_&#8216;cos I think this whole life is just overrated

this whole life is just too complicated

this whole life is just overrated now&#8230;&#8230;._
