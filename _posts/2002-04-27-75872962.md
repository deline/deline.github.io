My crappy life so far:

  1. I slept in the freaking rumpus room last night because my brother got shitty I wanted to sleep at 10.30pm. For a start it&#8217;s my freaking room, and it&#8217;s not my fault I&#8217;m tired because I&#8217;ve been doing my school work!
  2. My mum agreed with my brother to the above, and yet again I get told to shut up/be quiet by my mum and my brother. Last time I got yelled at because _I was doing my homework!_ and because I was depriving my brother of his chance to play games on the computer. Now excuse me if I&#8217;m wrong, but games verses Year 12 HSC assessments?!? Oh well, we&#8217;ll just let the games take priority, and I&#8217;ll just wait and get yelled at because I get shitty marks
  3. I&#8217;m always the only one around when someone decides to have a yell, so it get&#8217;s all directed at me, yet when I&#8217;m feeling shitty or need to have a yell I&#8217;m the one who gets told to _Quit my @#$&^%$_, or _Shut up_.
  4. The only thing my mother ever talks to me about is my brother and his oh so wonderful soccer team in which hes such a &#8216;fast runner&#8217;.
  5. Whenever I finalyl get into doing something, like doing my homework or assessments.. someone has to come an interrupt me. Then when I finally get back someone interrupts me again! And so the cycle continues
  6. I&#8217;m everyone&#8217;s freaking ragdoll to trash when they feel like it (how I see it, so probably a bit twisted as such)
