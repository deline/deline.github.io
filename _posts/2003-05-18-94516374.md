I went to the city yesterday and bought a cd &#8211; so, long astoria by The Ataris. I like their music and their songs&#8230; until you listen properly and read the lyrics even, it just seems like your usual punk rock song&#8230;. but really theres alot more meaning to it&#8230; deep meaning. Just like their previous album End Is Forever&#8230;
  
Decided on the laptop I&#8217;m getting the Compaq 800v. Yeah It&#8217;s processor is only 1.8Ghz and there up to like 2.2 or something for mobile P4s, but its good value, and I highly doubt I&#8217;m going to see the difference. I have a P3 800Mhz PC now and it kicks arse my brothers P4 2Ghz big time &#8211; only &#8216;cos I&#8217;ve looked after this heaps good. So yeah I should be getting the lappie round end June&#8230;. sweet as&#8230;.
