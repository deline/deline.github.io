One exam left to go =)
  
Find out next week if I passed the OOP exam or not&#8230; :-S Last semester apparently 2/3 failed first time round&#8230;
  
I got that ICC exam of mine back and I got 25/25 so I&#8217;m pretty pleased, &#8216;cos I kinda liked doing that assignment even though it took a \*very\* long time to research and write. Well it was on Information Systems which is one of my key passions in computing&#8230; hehe so maybe I&#8217;m just a little biased. But yeah, I hope I pass the ICC exam on Tuesday. It would be ace if I did pretty okay, as it&#8217;ll probably make me more inclined to take the IS Theories and Metholodgies as my sub-major next yr. Anyways I got to go back to reading/studying accounting and IRS systems, so off I go&#8230;&#8230; bye &#8211; goodluck to everyone else who has exams at the moment&#8230;..
