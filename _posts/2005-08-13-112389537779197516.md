Oh yeah did I mention that Reel Big Fish and Goldfinger are doing a combined show at the UNSW Roundhouse funnily enough called: CROUCHING FISH, HIDDEN FINGER. I&#8217;d go&#8230; but saving, and also I think I&#8217;m getting a bit old for the AA shows. Still nonetheless, it is agreed that this year is the best year for live music. Even the lineup for Homebake rocks (The Living End, Ben Lee etc)&#8230;
