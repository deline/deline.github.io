My gripe today&#8230; I&#8217;m sitting in the library doing my work&#8230; I usually work there with my headphones and music as I know that the area I sit at often has people doing group work. Anyways heaps of the singular working people also have headphones on&#8230; you know block out background noise etc. Anyways these people come along, and I&#8217;m like yeah it&#8217;s cool you can sit down. But argh&#8230; one of the people were like so whiny&#8230; I mean ffs the wireless doesn&#8217;t work, what do you want your bf to do about it, its out of their control&#8230;. but it wasn&#8217;t just that&#8230; you had to be there really&#8230;
