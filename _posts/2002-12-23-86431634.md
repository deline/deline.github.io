Sometimes don&#8217;t you just wish the ground would open up and swallow you down into the darkness of the Earth? Sometimes don&#8217;t you wish you could say what you really want to say? Sometimes do you wish that you weren&#8217;t here, but rather somewhere else, anywhere it doesn&#8217;t really matter? Sometimes I do.
