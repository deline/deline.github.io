In Agra at the moment. The weather is absolutley freezing, but lucky there is no wind, so we don&#8217;t have the added chill factor. Saw the Taj Mahal this morning. Was a really great sight, and quiet impressive.

Yesterday the journey to Agra took ages because of a road block because a truckie got bashed and they wanted justice, so they blocked to road of so the police would come. And whilst there it was a small town not use to Westerners so our leader Raj told us not to get of the bus. Which was probably a good idea as as we were about to start going, they decided to try there luck through the window and touch one of the other girls. Unfortunately for them our leader saw, jumped off the bus and shoved and whacked them (not to hard) across the top of the head. Was an interesting/funny experience at the same time.

Then last night we ended up drinking rum in his room because it was damn freezing cold. Which was kinda funny because our group is all girls and so we&#8217;re all bumming on the bed drinking and having stupid conversations. Good fun &#8211; don&#8217;t get the wrong idea though&#8230; we make jokes about it all the time&#8230;
