Well today drove my brother to school, headed to work to get some stuff which resulted in confusion over missing cds (?) then headed to visit my grandma. Stayed there for a bit came home made some phone calls, then headed back out to get Sal then on to Officeworks. Then as we had no easy way to turn back in the other direction on Epping Road we decided to go on to Chatswood for no particular reason. Anyways once got to Chatswood it was book and cd shopping&#8230; lol couldn&#8217;t resist. Then back towards North Ryde minus my &#8216;am I in the right lane?&#8217; questions as I had nfi where I was or where I was heading&#8230; eventually got back dropped Sal off, came home slept for about an hour or so whilst listening to Reel Big Fish then headed out around 3:30ish to go do some work. Then back home around 6:20 or so&#8230; and yeah so the story goes&#8230;

But yeah got two books, the new(ish) Area-7 single and one of Reel Big Fish&#8217;s old albums &#8211; Everything Sucks&#8230; now all I need to get my hands on is Turn The Radio Off&#8230; no point buying Favourite Noise as its just a compilation thingo of there cool songs&#8230;

But now it&#8217;s reading time and tomorrow I think I&#8217;m in the mood to do some vacuuming&#8230; too much dust&#8230; evil dust&#8230; I can&#8217;t stand my carpet&#8230; pity floorboards are $$$ &#8211; well nice ones anyway&#8230;
