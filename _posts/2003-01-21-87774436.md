Further additions to the movie watch list are:

  * Behind Enemy Lines
  * Bend It Like Beckham
  * Toy Story 2

I&#8217;ve watched Bend It Like Beckham twice since we&#8217;ve bought it, so three times overall (once at the movies). I liked that movie alot, &#8216;cos it was different and funny. But the ending at the aiport was a bit stupid I thought. It would have been perfectly fine, if not better without that soppy romantic twist at the end.

Other than that tomorrow I&#8217;m going shopping for thongs. Thongs as in the things you wear on your feet not the other americanised version (anyone been reading Column 8 in the SMH last week or so?). I&#8217;m also looking for new boardies as my old ones being sky blue go \*very\* see-through which defeats the whole purpose of wearing them in the first place.
