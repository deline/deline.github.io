Well yesterday started Assignment 3 for Business Processes and IT Strategy. This one is hard, because the articles are very confusing. My desk is covered in lots of journal articles and all. I think I&#8217;ve got an idea of what to write for the time being. The type of alignment exactly I&#8217;m not sure, it might help if I read the articles I&#8217;ve found.

Oh yesterday went to a travel agent. Looks like its all happening soon&#8230; mad. I&#8217;ll be like so broke after it, but you gotta do what you have to do.

Oh also, I&#8217;m quite intrigued at the latest plate/seismic activity around the world for some reason. The San Andreas fault 6.0 earthquake, and the pending eruption of Mount St Helens.
