Watched Day After Tomorrow today with some friends. Interesting movie in terms of climate change and all, though highly unlikely that such could ever occur over a period of 7 or so days. More like hundreds if not thousands of years. On which we could be in an ice age right now (undecided topic). Other than that catching up on my lack of reading&#8230; books people should read: A Long Way Down (good old dry humour), The Girl in Times Square, Rowing Without Oars. Meh and then I have to read HP 6 as well&#8230;
