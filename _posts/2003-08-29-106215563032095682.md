Today I went to work. They bought me a cake for my birthday which was last Sunday. That was cool/nice but I think I went red and didn&#8217;t say much. Well then again I usually don&#8217;t say much altogether (&#8216;specially if theres more than a few people). Eh and recently A.K/M has been mentioning how I \*have/should\* talk more. But that is so much easier said than done. And even though I feel somewhat older and somewhat more self-confident than I was in Yr 9, I have a feeling that communication wise, I&#8217;ve slipped backwards down the ladder. And I have that strange funny feeling inside me that others have noticed/sensed that too.
