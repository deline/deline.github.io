Hey I haven&#8217;t written here in like a week, but it&#8217;s been semi crazy. I&#8217;ve got trials starting in a week and 3 days and it&#8217;s pretty freaky. I have so got to revise over Maths and English and Earth and Environmental Science. I made my pact not to study for ITV, I guess we&#8217;ll just have to wait a while to see. Anyway today I talked about my sci assignment, and realised I have got a lot to do! On top of that there is the ITV assignment due next week, the SDD major and the IPT project. At least the IPT one&#8217;s almost done, just got doco&#8217;s to write up. Same goes for SDD, but the SDD doco&#8217;s are gonna be so long. My techy manual is almost 100 pages, well 90 to be exact and still increasing. And there&#8217;s still the User Manual, Installation Manual, Trouble Shooting Guide and Quick Reference Guide to go. Hey I reckon lots of us will end up running out our printing money. Anyone who does IPT has been printing like crazy these last few days. So much for &#8216;saving the trees&#8217; I say&#8230; though that&#8217;s a bit of an understatement seeing I print heaps too. I shoudl be going to bed soon, it&#8217;s getting late, and I&#8217;m supposed to be @ school round 7.45am tomorrow, even though I don&#8217;t have a period 0.
