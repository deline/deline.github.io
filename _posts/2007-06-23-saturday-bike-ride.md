So I got back a bit ago, and I just finished marking the route we took (well as best as I could remember) around the Drummoyne area I might&#8217;ve marked the wrong street, but it&#8217;s pretty much the same course. [Check it out&#8230;](http://maps.google.com.au/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&om=1&msa=0&msid=104733161136574679751.00000113570e5d6123c1a&ll=-33.848606,151.137714&spn=0.066436,0.160675&z=13)

And along the way I acquired (well bought) some gloves &#8216;cos it was freezing cold and my palms were hurting&#8230;
