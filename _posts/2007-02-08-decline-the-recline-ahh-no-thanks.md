So I&#8217;m on the net again. I reckon I spend a good $1-3 USD on net access per day. Actually I&#8217;m wasting time now but it&#8217;s letting me catch up on everything happening in the world around me. Like this article on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/travel/decline-the-recline--please/2007/02/08/1170524217817.html">declining the recline</a> which I don&#8217;t really agree with as the number one annoying habit. I&#8217;m kind of like, dude if your flying it&#8217;s to be expected. Like if the guy in front of you sticks their seat back, then you do and so on as it takes the domino effect down the plane. But I suppose if someone reclines their seat whilst your eating that could be annoying, but it&#8217;s never happened to me&#8230; as for screaming kids and loud talkers&#8230; that&#8217;s what headphones and the volume button is for.

Oh in other random travelling news I was sitting here (in this internet/travel joint) and I overheard this guy trying to organise a trip out to Banteay Srei. The people said the rate was $20 USD for a half day which was absurd (though sometimes it does cost a couple more dollars &#8216;cos it is fairly far out). Anyways I got up from my spot here and double checked where he wanted to go as I&#8217;m going out there tomorrow for half a day and am paying $10 USD for my driver. So it turned out we were heading to the same place, so I said he&#8217;s more than welcome to come along and share the ride seeing that I&#8217;ve already got transport arranged and all. So got that all sorted out, and will get my tuk tuk driver to swing buy the guy&#8217;s hotel after he picks me up at 7:30am. Sweet (plus it means I save $5 bucks).

Oh and I sorted out my trip to Battambang. Yet again I shall be waking up at some crazy hour. Something about pick up being at 5:15am?!? Suppose it&#8217;s not too bad. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve slept in past 7am. Try to do everything by the afternoon as it gets too hot and all you want to do is laze around.
