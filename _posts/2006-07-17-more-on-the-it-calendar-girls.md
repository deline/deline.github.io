The debate rages on&#8230;. [here](http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/calendar-girls-under-attack/2006/07/17/1152988460039.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1) and [here](http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/making-it-a-sexy-career-choice/2006/07/12/1152637721234.html)&#8230; and rightly so. It looks like others out there share a similar thought re the whole &#8216;concept&#8217;. If we shouldn&#8217;t need to deny our femininity to be accepted, do we need to make calendars showing it to be? Why can&#8217;t we just all continue as per normal&#8230;&#8230;
