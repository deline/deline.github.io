So I got the CD list thing happening, just have to clean the list up as it&#8217;s got a few music DVD entries in there, and write the admin/management backend for it. Next up on the list as well is to write code to present my Recent Tracks listing from my [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/deline/) account (formely Audioscrobbler). The question is to whether or not I strip the info from the [plain text file](http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/user/deline/recenttracks.txt) option, or write a parser for either the [RSS](http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/user/deline/recenttracks.rss) or [XML](http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/user/deline/recenttracks.xml) options. The first is the easier option, but nothing spesh a bit of a let down really&#8230;

Also went for a bit of a run/jog/walk today. Not having to walk some distance each day is driving me insane as it feels odd after having had to walk pretty much everywhere for a month.
