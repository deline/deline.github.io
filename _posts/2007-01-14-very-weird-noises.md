I&#8217;m at the doctors to check that im all immunised against everything and there is this really weird noise drifting down the hallway. Thank goodness for mp3 players!

Speaking of doctors i&#8217;m not at my usual one because they don&#8217;t open past 5.30pm on weekdays and the receptionist is a bit of a social snob in who can see the other doctor on Saturdays. Long story there but basically I don&#8217;t but it.

So i hope i have no problems here cos like my whole medical history since i&#8217;ve lived in Australia is at the other place.
