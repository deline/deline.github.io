Kinda on holz, but not really, more a 1 week study break before exams, so yeah I&#8217;m studying. Fill in on info: Networking Skills Group mark 100%, individual don&#8217;t know, Networking final online multiple choice 100%, UNIX 6/20!!! F%^K IT&#8230;. LOL&#8230; &#8216;cos of that I&#8217;m getting a D instead of a HD dammit. nah but it better that I passed overall (16/20 in previous) than have to repeat it.
  
Yeah I ended up buying a Dell&#8230; P-M chip and that Centrino stuff (even though a wireless card probably will still have better reception)&#8230; so yeah&#8230; I&#8217;m poor again. Should&#8217;ve paid another $127 to get XP Pro for IIS, but I didn&#8217;t find out Home didn&#8217;t have IIS. So yeah I&#8217;ll have to do the hack when I get it sometime. Anyways back to studying&#8230;
