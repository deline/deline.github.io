Okay&#8217;s so I watched my first whole Star Wars movie today. Star Wars: Episode III &#8211; Revenge of the Sith. And I&#8217;m surprised to say it was actually pretty good. I managed to stay awake, and actually make sense of what was going on. Now I might actually be able to watch episodes 4, 5 and 6. Oh and 1 and 2 as well&#8230; Lol I didn&#8217;t even know that Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker were brother and sister&#8230;
