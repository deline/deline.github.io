Argh I think I&#8217;m getting a cold&#8230; not good for a number of reasons. Other than that, yesterday was my last plants lab&#8230; (awww) but now I have a mini project report to write up. Lucky for me (and possibly quite so to my benefit), I asked yesterday how to write up a science report, as being a non-science student and all, the only reports I ever have to write have been business proposal style reports. Anyways I got a fairly detailed rundown of how it should be set out and presented, and also a better understanding of the context of the report as a whole. It shouldn&#8217;t be too bad now I think. Hey it&#8217;s definatley more fun than that PMQA report we have due around that time as well.
