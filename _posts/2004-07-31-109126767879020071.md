Like how cool is [this](http://modtown.co.uk/mt/review2.php?id=victorinox)?!? That is like one mad geeky gadget and a good combo as well. Many times have I wished I had a knife or scissors on me to open a box or cut some tape off. It&#8217;s like a totally geek tool. Beats having the keychain with light, usb key and carrying scissors and a screwdriver around at the same time then trying not to lose any of the items along the way.

Ahh one can dream that one had money to buy items for the sake of buying them&#8230; lol. Ook I think I&#8217;m going to buy a Crumpler bag&#8230; Wack-O-Phone or Roll-O-Notes probably.
