But let&#8217;s all pray that the weather stays fine-ish for the next 2 days. Off on a overnight camping/hiking/walking expedition somewhere in the Lower Blue Mountains. Otherwise my nifty utilisation of garbage bags may have to be put to use which who knows may result in what water stopping contraption.

Anyways thats enough from me, I gotta go do stuff&#8230;
