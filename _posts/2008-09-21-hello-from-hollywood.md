  So am in Hollywood right now. Flight over was way long. Ironically there were personal entertainment screens but I didn't watch any of the shows/movies though. Been down Hollywood Blvd this evening and tomorrow will head out to see other parts. Most likely Runyon Canyon and onwards to Beverly Hills.
