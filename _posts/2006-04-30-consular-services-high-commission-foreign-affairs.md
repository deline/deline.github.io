Who&#8217;d have thought it be so damn hard to find the website of Singapore&#8217;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Australia?!?! I think now I&#8217;m 21&#8230;. it&#8217;s time to chuck in the citizenship&#8230; as now there&#8217;s all these problems to do with me supposed to be voting in the election etc, but I don&#8217;t live there, and their law is that I can&#8217;t hold dual citizenship anyway.

Speaking of which I forgot to post that this year the Singapore Government are [giving away money](http://www.progress.gov.sg/) to their citizens &#8211; something they apparently do every few years. Because \*according\* to their records I&#8217;m a low income earner (clearly seeing I&#8217;ve never worked there!) I qualified for the full amount of [$800 SGD](http://www.progress.gov.sg/gd_ovw.htm). Except there&#8217;s a catch I don&#8217;t have a bank account in Singapore which means I can&#8217;t really claim my money. I could go the cheque option, but then I&#8217;d have to get the paperwork filled to authorise someone else to cash the cheque for money. And with the multitude of forms I&#8217;d to have to sign, they might actually realise I&#8217;m holding two citizenships andwasn&#8217;t meant to get it in the first place.
