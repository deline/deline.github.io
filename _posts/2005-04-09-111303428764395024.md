Caught up with Emily this afternoon. Went on a cycle over to Olympic Park / Bicentennial Park. One of the tracks we road down, was like spider corridor! Having all these spider webs above your head with like hundreds of massive spiders is like gross&#8230; even these outher cyclists stopped to have a look. The whole of that track was like that, towards the end, we were watching our path, and riding bent over just to avoid accidently riding into a web. Then on the way back we avoided that track&#8230; it was like spider nightmare&#8230;. Haha oh yeah on the way back I thought I spotted some onion weed, so we stopped, then spent like 10 minutes trying to madly dig onion weed out with our hands&#8230; failed miserably. We&#8217;d get down to a significant depth near where I was pretty sure the bulb would be near and then the plant would break. According to my dad, you can&#8217;t dig onion weed up with your hands, and yeah its a fragile plant. Oh well at least madly digging dirt with our hands was fun for a bit&#8230; until I had to get the dirt out from under my nails, and now my fingers hurt.
