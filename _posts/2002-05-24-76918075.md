It&#8217;s Friday night and I&#8217;m @ home, sitting in front of the screen coding away in NotePad. Pretty nerdy hey? But at least it&#8217;s constructive, and I like programming. Just finished the script to process the transaction to check out a book. It took like ages more than I thought it would take to code. I had to learn a whole new object! But now it&#8217;s done it&#8217;s pretty good, because I learnt new stuff in the process. Today school was interesting. Outta three lessons, I only had one actual lesson!, and to think I went one period early to do my homework! Anyway I just decided I would spend the rest of tonight trying to make more progress on my English feature article assessment.
