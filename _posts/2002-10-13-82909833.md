I actually reached my target of 3 English essays, IPT, SDD and ITV syllabuses summarised and all maths papers from 2001 &#8211; 1992 completed. I wish I could&#8217;ve done more English, as much of a torture it was, &#8216;cos I really need help. It took me yonks to do just one&#8230; like three or four days spending about 30 &#8211; 40min each day. Well school is back on tomorrow&#8230;. and I&#8217;m gonna go in for a few hours&#8230; cos I need to hand in those essays to get them checked&#8230;. and I need some help with maths. Well I better be off&#8230;.. I&#8217;m starting to stress 8 days to go&#8230;
