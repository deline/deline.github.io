On the days like today (or rather nights), where I waste hours trying to get something stupid to install only for it to absolutely not work regardless how many things I try. Argh I&#8217;m almost positive it&#8217;s because the software and drivers don&#8217;t support Vista, but if that&#8217;s the reason then that is a real pain. All I can say is stupid remote access and related software installs.
