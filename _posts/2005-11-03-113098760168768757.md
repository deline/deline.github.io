I am tired with a capital T. Final assignment was due today and I stayed up late last night (or should that be this morning) putting it together. Not exactly a great piece of work &#8211; in fact probably the worst &#8211; but given the circumstances, it will have to do. On the up note it was my last assignment, so tonight I can get a decent night&#8217;s sleep in 2 weeks. Except for the fact that 24 is on tonight and the new Morgan Spurlock doco 30 Days. And I have to work tomorrow and the traffic is a pain for a 3KM drive because of the tunnel collapse&#8230; Maybe that&#8217;s a reason to take to the bike tomorrow?

Or maybe I should stop complaining?
