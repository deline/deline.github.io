So what&#8217;s the mid-end week roundup? Well it&#8217;s been suprisingly great. Thursday was a half day of work, &#8216;cos the morning was offsite and then went out with some other grads and ex-grads at night for drinks&#8230; $2.50 vodka lemon, limes&#8230; bargin hey? Then today it was our paid day off to do volunteer work which was heaps good. Except we rocked up totally unprepared (I&#8217;ve never painted rooms before), so i resorted to tying a plastic bag round my head to protect my head from paint. Which was good I suppose considering I did hit my head on wet paint a few times. Then it was home mid afternoon and here I am&#8230;.
