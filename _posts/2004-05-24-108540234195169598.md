Mmm today had uni &#8217;twas okay&#8230; lots of work to do. Am amazed we actually went to see the subject coordinator during consultation hour. Still it was actually beneficial and I gained some more info into what is required, so it definatley wasn&#8217;t time wasted.

In other news I&#8217;m getting sick of uni I think&#8230; at least its holidays soon. Don&#8217;t like how everything is group work, as its a sucky assessor in certain aspects, though we all have to deal with it I suppose.

On the bright side, if I think of it in a twisted way I have 39 weeks of uni left in my degree&#8230; that&#8217;s like a bit short of 10 months if I calculate right. Can&#8217;t wait!
