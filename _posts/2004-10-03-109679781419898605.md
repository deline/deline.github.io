I think I&#8217;m infected again&#8230; this a) proves my prediction was correct and b) more than likely proves that either theres something in it, or something is dodgy. It&#8217;s been approx 9 weeks, and every 3 weeks it seems to come back to life. Dodgy as as well as annoying and uncomfortable and a right royal pain in the arse if you ask me. So it&#8217;s back to one sided eating. I need a plan. Tomorrow is a public holiday so I can&#8217;t conact the surgeon. Tuesday and Friday are my only free days. Friday is too late. Now how to I book and appointment for Tuesday before Tuesday?

Grrr annoyed about it. It&#8217;s the never ending saga of the weird infection!
