Why is life confusing? Anyways to cut a long story short, it seems I may be good at research and should consider it. That poses a bit of a dilemma, as whilst I enjoy researching etc, I&#8217;m not a fan of having to articulate my thoughts/findings (see post a few posts down) as information overload and brain strain gets the better of me&#8230; That said, I have a few interests that would make a good research project if I ever do decide to head that way. Just stuff which perplexes me in some form or another which is mainly the sociology aspect of IT. Meh some more stuff to ponder upon.
