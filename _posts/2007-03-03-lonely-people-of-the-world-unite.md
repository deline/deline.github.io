For some reason the name of this album had popped up in my head recently&#8230;

![](http://www.devindaviswebsite.com/images/home_06.jpg)

It&#8217;s sort of indie rock with a few catchy songs&#8230; I can&#8217;t recally exactly when I listened to it for the first time. but I seem to remember thinking the title was awesome in some weird way or another&#8230;

But deviating from the above&#8230; why is the weather so hot??? I know it&#8217;s excellent beach weather and all, but when your aircon is semi dead (i.e. leaking water issue), it&#8217;s kind of somewhat painful even sitting in complete darkness&#8230;
