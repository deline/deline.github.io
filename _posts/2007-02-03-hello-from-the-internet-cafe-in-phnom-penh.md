Well I got here okay. My accomo is okay, I think it&#8217;s a bit overpriced for what I paid, so I probably won&#8217;t stay there Monday night&#8230; I&#8217;ll go for something in the cheaper range. But it&#8217;s in walking distance to the riverside so alls good.

Woke up super early this morning like at 1am which is 5am Sydney time which is probably when I usually start waking up gradually on a normal day&#8230; but I managed to get back to sleep. Eventually woke up at a more normal time, and headed out to visit the killing fields and Toul Sleung. Booked my ticket for the bus to Siem Reap as well and checked out a market.

Oh as to be expected, the traffic is nutters here as well&#8230; even though i&#8217;ve been places where you kinda just step out and slowly make your way across the road, it&#8217;s always freaky when you have to do it yourself..

Oh and the bigÂ \*oh!\* comes by me saying they drive on the other side of the road! so when I walk up to a road I&#8217;m like super careful cos I always seem to look the wrong way first!

That&#8217;s it for now, my hour is up soon, so Im going to head up the river on a walk&#8230;
