I have my final online multiple choice exam for Networking 1 next week&#8230; there&#8217;s still the written exam to go. I think if I pass the online exam I&#8217;ve passed CCNA 1? Not 100% though. Today we did the pre test, which is a test we did at the start of the subject to see how much we know. At the start I got 60% but this time I got 97.5% (39/40) which I guess was pretty good. But still, can&#8217;t get to sure of myself, even if the tutor said I should do fine next week. You never know what destiny/fate (whatever it is) holds.

But now I&#8217;m madly finishing ICC, I really just have finishing sentences to put in here and there and then I&#8217;ll be done, but its taking just a tad longer than I hoped. But that&#8217;s what usually happens, I leave the last couple of sentences till a few days before, then finish it all up, because I have to stop procrastinating&#8230;. but yeah I should get back to it&#8230;
