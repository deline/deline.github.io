So I went on a bit of shopping splurge today. New Foo Fighters and Oasis albums, Eyetoy: Play 2 and Antigrav. Was always wanting to buy Eyetoy for ages, but never got round to it as only really play games in the hols. Seeing it was close enough to the holidays, and I need something to distract me from my study, it was time to hit the shops. Play 2 is a great party game&#8230; definatley when I organise post semester get together we&#8217;re going to play it &#8211; the more the merrier. Antigrav is mad as well, looks like I&#8217;ll be getting a few exercise workouts, courtesy of the PS2 strangely enough. Oh and my bicycle, if I get around to replacing the front tyre tube&#8230; first have to work out if it&#8217;s a 24&#8243; or 26&#8243; wheel.
