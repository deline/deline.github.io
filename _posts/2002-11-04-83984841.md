A week and three days till my last exam, if I calculated correctly. Well after SDD, I took a break on the weekend went shopping, formatted my comp and organised it all neatly. Been waiting to do that for a year, formatting the comp that is. So now it&#8217;s all up and swish and clean. Well I should be studying for science right now, I&#8217;ve read Tectonic Impacts so far and am about a quarter way through Environments Through Time. I need to focus on Environments Through Time I Think, because the chapter seems pretty large and complex. So yeah, I s&#8217;pose I should get going and go back to reading.
