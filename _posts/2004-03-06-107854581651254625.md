I feel SO tired and I slept for 10 and a half hours last night!!! I think maybe it&#8217;s &#8216;cos I&#8217;ve been doing work all day, spent a good part of the day so far reading for IT Operations Management. It&#8217;s what I&#8217;d call the reading subject for the semester. It&#8217;s okay but, one of the books is very motivational. Lol, and I never thought I&#8217;d say this, but I s&#8217;pose it&#8217;s the only subject where having done IT VET may have helped a bit. &#8216;Cos I s&#8217;pose in IT VET we touched a bit on resource acquisation, role of IT Manager, disaster recovery etc. But I have to say it&#8217;s more interesting at uni, because the content covered is more detailed and in depth, and people are generally more motivated.

Anyways yeah went fishing last night. Caught 5 small snapper, so had to chuck them back. Tonight, we have to go to some streeto thingo down at the bowling club, then if we&#8217;re up to it, we might go over to the wharf to drop some crab nets to see if we have any luck. Mmm the review of Fleetwood Mac on Thursday night was pretty poor. But then again sometimes reviews are biased. I guess I&#8217;ll have to wait and see for myself tomorrow.

Oh in other notes, I think my credit card bill for this month will be heaps. Lots of books I&#8217;ve bought. Bah reminder that I have to go an pay my credit card bill now. Adios&#8230;
