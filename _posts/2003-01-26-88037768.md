So today I went driving again today&#8230; after driving back today, my dad made me start on a hill and try and balance/control the car just using the clutch and acelerator. I sorta could do it on the steep hill.. but when I rolled, I rolled heaps! But then on a very slight slope, I couldn&#8217;t keep it still and either moved to far forward or rolled to far back. Other than that today went to Chatswood as well, and finally bought a pair of thongs, their okay, they will do. Then this arvo, been sleeping for half ot it&#8230; what more to do then sleep on a Sunday when its overly hot outside and you have air conditioning on the inside? Meh I probably sound lazy. But I&#8217;m going for a jog/run in about 10 minutes&#8230; I wonder if it&#8217;ll be cooler by then?
