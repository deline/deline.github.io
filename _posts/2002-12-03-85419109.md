Great all the photos I took in Noosa are f#$%^d! Battery died up there and it just so happened that the motor thingo that winds the film jammed. My brother and dad decided to try fix it&#8230;. but couldn&#8217;t. Though I reckon I could&#8217;ve at least tried&#8230; at least I would&#8217;ve attempted to open it up in the dark. Actually what I would&#8217;ve done is open the film cover up, then put in a new battery, then close the film slot to see if it reset. So shit to all my photos is all I can say. I feel like swearing&#8230; but I&#8217;ll resist the urge to do so. Hmm this is probably the most semi-annoyed and frustrated blog I&#8217;ve ever posted&#8230; Well it was the only roll pf photos I took before the battery died! How much do I wish now that we already had our digital camera. Hmm yeah we&#8217;re getting a digital camera. A Canon G2.

Grr&#8230; I&#8217;m in a shitty mood now. Actually I take that back&#8230; shitty mood equates to down in the dumps&#8230; this is just a &#8216;Grrrrr&#8230; how so annoying&#8217; mood. I better leave now&#8230; before I do my keyboard damage. Nah I&#8217;d never do such&#8230;
