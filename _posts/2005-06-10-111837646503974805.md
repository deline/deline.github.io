I had one of those self reflective moments today&#8230; the ones where you just think about life&#8230; and I think for a part of me, one of my views is to try/do the best that I can&#8230; It&#8217;s seems an odd statement, but to me, it&#8217;s something that means a lot&#8230; it&#8217;s worth it alone just for the experiences amongst a multitude of other things.

Other than that my weekend plans involve catching up on my study, watching Star Wars Ep 3, my cousins birthday and catching up with Emily on Sunday for a bike ride over to Homebush&#8230; looking good.
