Well I&#8217;m at uni now&#8230; waiting round till 7.30pm as have to go to a lecture to promote the new 1st Year Peer Learning Support. Who&#8217;d have thought 3-4 years ago, that I&#8217;d be standing at the front of a lecture theatre promoting stuff. I guess things change (for the better in this case). Anyways yeah today I had science and we we&#8217;re doing micropropagation&#8230; lol we had to wear these blue shoe covers, a hair net, a mask, labcoat and gloves&#8230;. kinda funny, people all covered in white, with blue looking feet. Met some new people again&#8230; lol every week I meet new people in PP&E. It&#8217;s good though.
