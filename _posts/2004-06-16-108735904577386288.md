I am so tired&#8230; exams continous in a row at 9.30am in the morning is very tiring because have to wake up early to get to uni without getting stuck in peak hour traffic.

Mmm anyways yeh nothing is happening at the moment. Half way through exams then hols. sally&#8217;s coming down to syd, so thats pretty cool, other than that and upcoming gigs to go to/see anyone else got any plans for next week?

Blah this post is incohrerent..
