I went on a bike ride this morning&#8230; quite suprised that I actually woke up. It&#8217;s more refreshing in the morning than in the afternoon though, I must say. Yeah kind of starting an exercise routine&#8230; bike ride, a few stomach crunches and some squats. And some dumb bells for the arms. Time to get fit&#8230; and toned&#8230; hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to keep it up, this time not just for the holidays, but for at least half of next year as well&#8230;. or make it my mission to exercise at least once a week.
  
Well I&#8217;m going in to uni today for a few hours maybe&#8230; haven&#8217;t been that productive at home with OOD (which is a suprise), so I might get more done there with uni buddies&#8230; which is weird, &#8216;cos I have always studied by myself. Like last year when we had class study/revision session before the hsc, I just sat there and did crap all&#8230;. &#8216;cos I get distracted easily when I&#8217;m not alone and focused.
  
Oh Sal comes back next week some time&#8230; yay&#8230; but she&#8217;s working most days&#8230;. still it&#8217;ll be cool to catch up&#8230;
