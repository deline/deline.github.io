Well it&#8217;s back to uni today. Am tired, even though got at least 8 hours of sleep last night. Probably got around 9 actually &#8216;cos I think I went to sleep before 11pm??? Had to fill up petrol on the way to dropping Calv at school, so my wallet&#8217;s almost empty again (well until I find an ATM). Lol I worked out where all my money goes&#8230; stupid bus tickets, food, petrol. It&#8217;s roughly $20 per week for public tranpost expenses to and from uni. And chuck in a few meals when theres no food at home or I&#8217;m starving. Bah and if I start the swimming again thats like $4 each swim or something like that.

But yeah, back to uni and I&#8217;m sitting at home. Well &#8216;cos I don&#8217;t start till 2pm. Leaving in an hour or so anyways to go to Ticketek and meet some ppls down at Market City. Anyway I&#8217;m off to listen to more music and do some more flicking between the various windows that are on my taskbar in an attempt to be more productive.
