Woke up, wished that I was dead
  
With an aching in my head
  
I lay motionless in bed
  
The night is here
  
The day is gone
  
And the world spins madly on

_World Spins Madly on &#8211; [The Weepies](http://www.theweepies.com/)_

For the first time ever, the other night I told someone what I had once felt. And I guess that the lyrics from the above song kind of summed up what I pretty much said. Except I didn&#8217;t actually know the lyrics to the said song I like till today which is kind of ironic.

But on to other stuff&#8230; the world does really spin madly on. We&#8217;re almost at the end of February. It doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but for me its huge for many reasons.
