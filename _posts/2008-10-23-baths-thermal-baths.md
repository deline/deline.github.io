  Today included a visit to one of the many thermal baths that exist in Budapest. A visit to one of the more touristy oriented ones was made so no nudie bathing required (more traditional baths have different days for males and females and are in the no bathing gear sense).

  The 37.35 degree celsius water of one of the outdoor pools was really nice and warm. Like a huge never ending bath... and with fountains and jets as well!

  Also went on a tour of the Parliament building which was quite pretty and nice, with lots of gold things...

  Tomorrow is actually Hungary's Republic Day so it will be visiting some museums and the zoo and stuff, as most other stuff is closed. Found some of the museums closed a different day this week to stay open tomorrow.

  Anyways that's it for tonight.... (and maybe the trip)
