  Sport... Once a weekend habit of my former younger life died when I jumped on the geek wagon and delved in the world of computers and weekend newspaper selling.

  But oh how I missed thee and only realised in the last year or two. But alas old age has taken it's toll and I'm now afflicted with a stuffed right foot which hurts when I run and now requires overpriced sport tape (wonders if they sell in bulk?)

Sport&#8230; Once a weekend habit of my former younger life died when I jumped on the geek wagon and delved in the world of computers and weekend newspaper selling.

But oh how I missed thee and only realised in the last year or two. But alas old age has taken it&#8217;s toll and I&#8217;m now afflicted with a stuffed right foot which hurts when I run and now requires overpriced sport tape (wonders if they sell in bulk?)

In all seriousness though, even with the stuffed foot, I&#8217;m enjoying sport immensely. Had our Oztag grand final last Monday and the game was pretty even&#8230; until about the last 5 minutes when a kick/chase move was played out by the opposition to win them the game. So now that that&#8217;s over for the season (hoping we enter the winter comp&#8230;), soccer has started up and I&#8217;m back in action. If not feeling a little bit unfit from this morning&#8217;s training which involved way to much running for my foot&#8217;s liking&#8230;
