I had an interview today&#8230; I find out in the next few days the outcome&#8230; I don&#8217;t know how it went. It was one of those moments where I have no clue whatsoever how the outcome will be. I have a strong feeling though, that I won&#8217;t be offered an offer. We&#8217;ll see and I&#8217;ll do a postback in a few days about the outcome. Ultimatley either way, I am glad to have even had the opportunity to get thay far. The last few months have been alot of new experiences for me, and I&#8217;ve definatley learned alot in the process.

In other news, I got my herbarium and final plant ID test back. It&#8217;s really ironic that my best performing subject this semester is my non-IT elective (a science subject). At the start of the semester, I was quite concerned after hearing what the subject involved and the biology aspect of it all. But so far so good. It&#8217;s probably on par as one of my fave subjects this semester. Though I am a bit concerned about the final exam &#8211; again because of the biology aspect.
