I played the piano quite a bit yesterday&#8230; this time Brick. Ben Folds Five have good pieces which are emotive so they&#8217;re pretty good to play on piano. I studied a bit, but spent more time playing. It allows my brain to focus on something else. I knew that once exams started I&#8217;d be pretty wonked out after each exam, so I guess it was good I started studying ages ago. But today I really have to read my notes. IPT is up tomorrow. I&#8217;m looking forward to it, whilst at the same time freaked. Who knows what will hold&#8230;
