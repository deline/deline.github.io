excerpt: |
  At the airport waiting for my flight to Vientiane, Laos. Got about 30 min to go till boarding. All things going to plan should land in Vientiane round 9:30am and try to find Emily at the airport,
  
  Other than that I think Wizard blocked my credit card. Probably didn't help that the first time I used it I put like 3 transactions in one day totaling a few hundred dollars. I think they might have tried and ring me but I cancelled the call as it costs me to answer. Might try to find a payphone...
  
  Probably going quiet for a few days too as going to try and head to Si Phan Don (4000 islands) and they only just got electricity last month.
