I&#8217;m bored and I can&#8217;t wait till school is over. I&#8217;m practically counting the weeks down. In most of the courses we&#8217;re doing our last unit now, and there&#8217;s quite a few assessments round week 6/7 which is going to be stressful. We haven&#8217;t got our UAC books yet!!! I really hope we get them tomorrow, otherwise, I might just go and buy myself a copy. Right now I&#8217;m fixing up this uni application questionaire thingo so that I can get it checked sometime, so I guess I better get back to it.
