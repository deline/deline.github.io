Well caught up with some friends for drinks + dinner tonight which was great. I haven&#8217;t seen half of these people in ages (if not years!))&#8230; Strangely enough I made it home in time before Live 8 started, so now I&#8217;m wide awake following/watching the broadcast over the Internet as well as the radio. U2 and Coldplay were really good. Coldplay only played 3 songs, one of which was a cover of The Verve&#8217;s, Bittersweet Symphony, with Richard Ashcroft actually singing. I wonder if I&#8217;ll mamage to stay up till 6:30am tomorrow? Somehow I doubt. Oh well hope they release it on DVD or something. And I hope Snow Patrol, Stereophonics and REM come on before lilke 2am (Sydney time!)&#8230;&#8230;. here&#8217;s to hoping
