Mmm firstly a post of my stupidity. I was watching tv with a cup of tea (hot) in my hand sitting in the dark. I went to take a sip, missed and ended up tipping it over/down my shirt. Not good when the water/tea is still quite hot. But also kinda stupid, because how do you miss directing the cup at your mouth??? It&#8217;s like an art you master when your a baby!&#8230; anyways uni was good today, short lecture because the scheduled lecturer couldn&#8217;t make it. Caught up with some friends from the science subject which &#8217;twas good.
