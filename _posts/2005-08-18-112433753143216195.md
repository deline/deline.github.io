[The new divide: when desktops become laptops &#8211; Technology &#8211; smh.com.au](http://smh.com.au/news/technology/the-new-divide-when-desktops-become-laptops/2005/08/17/1123958129773.html) The way of the future or not? Personally the idea is promising, but isn&#8217;t exactly viable anywhere in the near future. The infrastructure alone is alot of $$$, but you can&#8217;t force people in buying products because &#8216;they have too&#8217;. The Digital Divide is still alive and kicking and it&#8217;s something to bear in mind before we start praising the digital revolution. There are many people who cannot and probably will never be able to experiece technology as many of us do.
