Who&#8217;d have thought that out of a group of 6 random people, we&#8217;re all not really public speakers? Great work considering we to present in front of like a full lecture theatre (approx 200 ppl) in 2 weeks time. So for the time being I&#8217;m the token speaker person, cos I think (?) I&#8217;ll be able to do it. My plan? Don&#8217;t wear glasses or contacts so I can&#8217;t see the audience&#8230; mwahhh&#8230;

Anyway the weather has been kind of crazy recently, after a really warm winter it is now windy, grey and rainy. It better be sunny tomorrow &#8216;cos Emily asked me to go climb the Harbour Bridge with her so I don&#8217;t want to get blown all around everywhere&#8230; (okay maybe a slight exaggeration).

Oh yeah side note, everyone watch Grey&#8217;s Anatomy on Monday&#8230; It&#8217;s going to be a great episode! (trust me)
