Bought the Coldplay album Rush Of Blood To The Head yesterday&#8230; it&#8217;s good if you want to listen to kind of melancholy tunes&#8230; good for days where you just want to laze around. Tomorrow is NYE. Still have yet to finalise what to do. Hmm I think I will go an run of some CDs onto tape.
