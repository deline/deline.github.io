So today&#8217;s day 1 of the [pedometer challenge](http://www.gcc2007.com/). I do wonder about that stepcount counter on the front though, as everytime I&#8217;ve been to the site it&#8217;s endlessly ticking, which unless they are just incrementing upwards through the current totally step count, reminds me of just a ticker. Because, wouldn&#8217;t there reach some point where it can&#8217;t tick no more &#8211; or are people really walking that much???
