Well suprising that today was actually okay. Um today I&#8217;ve been feeling tiredish&#8230; like a piece of lead sinking to the bottom of the ocean. Have work tomorrows then uni&#8230; Counting down the days. They have gone pass quick. Calvin already halfway through his exams&#8230; so only 2 more days I have to drive him to school&#8230; which means more time to sleep instead of having to wake up at 8am&#8230;
