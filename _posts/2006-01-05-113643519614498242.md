So I&#8217;ve spent the better half of today trying to configure PHP, MySQL and phpMyAdmin. MySQL 5.0 definatley has big changes, even the installation was significantly different. Which kind of explains why it was such a pain in the you-know-what to configure everything. That said, no complaints, the administrative features for MySQL are way better than prior releases. Plus it has transactional support as well as better support for RDBMS and referential integrity which is a good thing. But this half day of typing and config work has screwed my right shoulder over and it&#8217;s hurting now&#8230; sign of RSI perhaps?

Other than that&#8230; I wish the weather would clear up so I can go on a bike ride&#8230;
