It&#8217;s still freezing cold @ 10:18am. I&#8217;ve been up since 6am, outside in the cold between 6:45 &#8211; 8:45, and now I&#8217;m back at my computer. And it&#8217;s still freezing. My fingers are like sort of numb, which makes it weird to type. What I need is a nice hot cup of soup, or something along the lines like that. I&#8217;ve been mucking round with PDF Distiller and Word, and boy is it annoying. Bookmarks I get, but how the hell do I make a structured bookmark?!? Anyway I shouldn&#8217;t even my doing what I&#8217;m doing, I should be doing my English homework. Argh&#8230; I always get distracted.
