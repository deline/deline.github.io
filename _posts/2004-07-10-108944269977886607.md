Today got contact lenses to try&#8230; very hard for someone else to put in, but very very hard to take out by self. Afterwards visited grandma and had lunch at home with her. Pretty much quiet Saturday nothing much happening. Oh booked in to get wisdom teeth pulled on 19th of August. Here&#8217;s to hoping everything goes well and it doesn&#8217;t hurt too much. Plus it&#8217;s my brothers 18th party the next day even though I&#8217;m supposed to have uni that night, but I doubt I could go to uni anyway drugged up on pain killers I doubt I&#8217;d want to be walking around the city at night by myself.
