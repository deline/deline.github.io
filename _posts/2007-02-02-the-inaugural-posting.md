Yep here it is. Had a pretty good flight. Sat next to a couple who were going to India and they&#8217;ve been to Cambodia so we swapped info about the countries and so on. Unfortunatley for me, I broke my no sleep routine and fell asleep for a good few hours. I think that&#8217;s what happens when you go to bed at 1am and then wake up at 4:30am&#8230;

oh and a random side question &#8211; why does Sydney Airport have nowhere that sells toothpaste?

off to find some toothpaste now&#8230;
