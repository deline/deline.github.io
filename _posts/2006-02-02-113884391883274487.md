Now that ratings season is starting up again, my TV schedule has suddenly exploded. My weekly schedule now somewhat consists of:
  
Monday &#8211; Grey&#8217;s (d/l), DH
  
Tuesday &#8211; The O.C., 24 (d/l)
  
Wednesday &#8211; Prison Break followed by The O.C. (season 1 on cable)
  
Thursday &#8211; Lost (as I stopped mid-way keeping up with the U.S.)
  
Friday &#8211; Veronica Mars, World Poker Tour

sad hey? we&#8217;ll see in a month what get&#8217;s culled&#8230;
