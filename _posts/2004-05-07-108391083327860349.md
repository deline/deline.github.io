Well it&#8217;s 4:07 pm and I&#8217;m at uni. Just bumming, Actually I&#8217;m typing my revision/summary up for some of my subjects. Normally I&#8217;d be on my way home now, but Sal sms-ed me today and shes back in Sydney, and today&#8217;s her only free night, so were catching up and going to have dinner&#8230; cools, will be good/nice. It&#8217;s cool that we&#8217;ve still managed to be friends after high school even though we live in two totally different cities/places for the better part of the year.

In other news, the electrical engineers at dad&#8217;s work checked the PSU more, and its definatley dead. Lol they were saying if they could fix it they would&#8230; and I was to my dad&#8230;. um&#8230; you know your not meant to open the actual PSU box up, but then again I suppose they \*are\* electrical engineers&#8230; so who am I to talk. So yeah tomorrow probably head over to Strathfield (dad mentioned something about a comp store there that was reasonable), and head over to Maq as well to look at stuff, buy a torx screwdriver etc&#8230; Then on Sunday gotta head up to West Pennant Hills to do some work related stuff.

Pretty busy weekend eh? But better than procrastinating either way. Mmm haven&#8217;t spoken to Em in a bit&#8230; that&#8217;s a reminder to myself that I have to pick up the Offspring tickets someday&#8230;
