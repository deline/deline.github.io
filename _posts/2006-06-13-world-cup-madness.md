So the first Aussie match was on last night and I wasn&#8217;t going to watch it&#8230; but midway through my sleep, I heard this loud cheering from the TV room by my dad and brother&#8230; so I \*had\* to wake up to see what all the yelling was about. Turns out Australia scored a goal (well their second). And I stayed up to watch the final one get scored as well. Pretty good I say to go from 0 &#8211; 1 to 3 &#8211; 1 in the last 8 or so minutes&#8230;
