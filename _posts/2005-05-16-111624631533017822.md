Okay for today&#8217;s randomness, I&#8217;m sitting in MC eating a bread thingy for lunch before heading to my lecture&#8230; anyways I see this lady come up the escalator but on the wrong side &#8211; i.e. came up the down escalator. Now she looked in a rush like running up, but even if she was in a rush, wouldn&#8217;t it make more sense to run up the up escalator than up the down escalator??? and she wasn&#8217;t like a teen she was like 20+
