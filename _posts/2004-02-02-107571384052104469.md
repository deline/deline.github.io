So a few days gone by without a blog, hmm yeah it was a pretty good weekend I suppose. So now I&#8217;ll do the fill in. Went to the beach both days, Sat with my bro and dad&#8230; saw quite a few grouper, even touched some. Sunday went with Sal &#8211; &#8217;twas good. Fish are so cool and dumb you sprinkle sand on your way back to the surface and they all come swarm around you because they think it is food. Ears started hurting a bit, as a few times I didn&#8217;t clear them properly, as had to dive down like 2 &#8211; 3 metres to get to the bottom >.._</p>
