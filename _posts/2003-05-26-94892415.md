Am I boring? Do I lead a boring life? Compared to a normal person my age, I guess I would have to say yes. But the thing is, all those &#8216;normal&#8217; things don&#8217;t appeal to me. Well I don&#8217;t know if the normal ever has&#8230; I&#8217;m more of an abnormal sort than the norm. I&#8217;d much rather be working, whether just in my own time for fun learning new stuff, or working for $. Yes strange&#8230; very strange I hear you say. Maybe a somewhat workaholic? Well I wouldn&#8217;t go as far as say that, just motivated and passionate about what Iike/love doing. Yeah \*nerdy\*&#8230; hahaha
  
Sometimes uni is good, sometimes it is okay. But it sure as hell ain&#8217;t the &#8216;best time of my life&#8217;. When was my best time of my life? Guess maybe the future holds that answer, but mid year 10 to mid year 11 were pretty okay I think.
  
Anyways I gotta go study, I got end semester exams in like 3 weeks&#8230; need to revise for Networking and ICC&#8230; and finish this assignment.. I&#8217;m getting there&#8230;. eventually&#8230; except damn my net connection is going to be capped in the next few days&#8230;&#8230;.
