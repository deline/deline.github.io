Okay so I&#8217;m not really a fan of public singing, but Singstar Rocks! does have a fairly [wicked track list](http://au.playstation.com/ps2/games/s/singstarrocks.jhtml). Though I wonder if that is correct, as other sites like [JB Hi-Fi](http://www.jbhifionline.com.au/games/id/848544) talk about Snow Patrol and Bloc party on it. Maybe the Australian version is Australianised &#8211; hence the lot of Aussie bands on it?
