I climbed in a bin today. A dumpster bin. Lucky for me it was a new/emptied one, so there wasn&#8217;t much stuff in there. Found what I was looking for though which I guess was good. Wednesdays kill me, well Monday and Tuesday do, but Wednesdays is like the peak of it. Working then 6 hours uni straight kills me, then I have to come home (now) and prepare for the classes I&#8217;m taking tomorrow &#8211; reading the exercises they&#8217;ll be doing, and going through them myself. Then on Fri PMQA. Argh first Plant ID test next week, please help me someone&#8230; anyone&#8230; I can only remember about 14 plants out of 30 so far&#8230;.. everywhere I walk/go now, I&#8217;m looking at plants, checking out the leaves, my life revolves around plants&#8230; oh well
