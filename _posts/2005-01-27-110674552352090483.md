Crazy, crazy tennis. I&#8217;ve been watching it heaps these last few days. Today did the stretch pretty much from 1pm till about 10 minutes ago!!! Argh as much as I can&#8217;t stand Hewitt&#8217;s on-court antics, he&#8217;s Australian, so yeah. Good match though from both the Aussies today. My predictions Federer and Hewitt to the final. Roddick doesn&#8217;t seem as agile as Hewitt is on his toes. Though that&#8217;s just my prediction&#8230; which probably will be wrong. Highlights of tomorrow: Sharapova vs Williams and Federer vs Safin. Reckon Davenport will win her match easy hence not a highlight. In between all that I hopefull will read more. Reading the book &#8216;This Game Of Ghosts&#8217; by Joe Simpson which is kinda a autobiography/memoir of the mountaineer who had that accident on Siula Grande.
