excerpt: |
  Today headed out to the Kuang Si Falls which are about 30KM out of Luang Prabung. The waterfall was quite impressive with many pools with clear blue water, some of which swimming was allowed. After walking up what seemed like a million stairs to the top, we came back down and went for a swim. The water at first seemed quite cold but soon became bearable and was in fact rather refreshing.

  That is until I stood still a little too long and a fish nibbled at my left big toe. It hurt. Soon later something nibbled on my right foot after which I decided if my feet were on the ground they were going to be constantly moving.

  Got back to Luang Prabung mid afternoon and went and booked myself on a one day cooking course tomorrow. I was deciding between two places, however by the time I came back my first choice was booked out, so luckily for me my second choice had one spot left. So I'll be spending 10am - 5pm tomorrow cooking... maybe I'll pick up some culinary skills to add to my somewhat limited food skillset?

  Anyways got to catch up on some internet... was planning on using free wifi, but there was a power blackout and I'd already eaten and didn't want to eat again so at an internet place...
