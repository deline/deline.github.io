Okay maybe not glorious, but a few of us entered in the NRMA Carefight Woodford to Glenbrook. Now we all thought it was 25KM but after having walked it, it was actually probably closer to 30KM. See from Woodford Station we had to walk 1KM to pick up our bibs then walk 1KM back to the starting point. That plus the 25KM is already 27KM. But reading the entry form again it says it follows 25KM of fire trails and there was a portion at the start of maybe a KM or so that wasn&#8217;t fire trail as well.

But I bailed at the last 4KM and hopped into the truck because my feet and legs were close to physically incapable of going further. Well it was that and the time and pain it took to get from 6KM to 4KM was too intense to bother exerting the other 4KM out. So I abandoned and the trio became 2 who actually made it all the way. All up though ignoring the last 4 KM I&#8217;m pretty sure I was either just around 25KM or a bit under (based on my pedometer reading).

Thinking about it 25KM was pretty damn far for a day and I think we all went through the denial phase of what we had got ourselves into. All up a good day but I&#8217;ll probably pay for it tomorrow!
