Woot another tour! I&#8217;m not surprised at all this is happening, but with all the airplay they&#8217;ve got recently on ER, Jericho, One Tree Hill, the 3 times they&#8217;ve been played on Grey&#8217;s plus the reference to their album on Veronica Mars, the gig is going to be packed with an awful lot of teenyboppers.

Either way, I&#8217;m going to be there for sure&#8230; here&#8217;s to hoping they play stuff from Songs For Polarbears&#8230;

ahhhhh the last 1+ years has been an awesome music year&#8230; Stereophonics, Oasis, The Living End, Coldplay, Snow Patrol, Ben Folds and U2

Not to mention coming up in the first half of 2007 &#8211; The Killers, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Snow Patrol (again ðŸ™‚ )
