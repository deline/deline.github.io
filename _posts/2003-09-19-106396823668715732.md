It was kind of funny/weird in a way today, as I was getting a lift home from work and having a convo. And anyways, thats the second person who&#8217;s kind of mentioned that I&#8217;m similar in some aspects to S.H. But I guess the main difference, is I don&#8217;t really find uni that much better than high school (as I&#8217;ve mentioned in previous posts). My friends at uni are cool&#8230; but talking in the bigger picture, it&#8217;s much the same that high school was. Groupy, and that superficialness that exists. And maybe because I&#8217;ve got very focused goals which I&#8217;ve had for years so to some degree it makes it hard to relate (for all involved). Ahh I dunno&#8230; I guess I&#8217;m just muddled.
