_And if you tolerate this this&#8230;_ It was my brothers birthday today. Nothing big today &#8216;cos he&#8217;s got some party happening on the 20th. Funny on my 18th I was doing an assessment or something if I remember right. Ha and my mum said my brother said they should have a 21st for me because I didn&#8217;t have a big 18th party. Though I doubt I&#8217;d want a big 21st anyway. Just maybe go out with some of my friends (good). I&#8217;m not one for a party of randoms, well not randoms as such but people I&#8217;m remotley acquainted with. That&#8217;s just me and my weirdness again. Do you reckon that theres always one eccentric one in every family??? I kind of do but I don&#8217;t. &#8216;Cos when I think about it not \*all\* families have one. Maybe more like theres always a few eccentrics in the extended family?

Mum bought me some clothes today. I have to change one for a bigger size tomorrow. &#8216;Cos I&#8217;d prefer it looser on the shoulders, otherwise it&#8217;d be good. Lol actually getting decent presents this year.. more than usual. I think I know why the suddeness&#8230; but I can&#8217;t seem to write it properly here without it coming out possibly wrongly interpretable.
