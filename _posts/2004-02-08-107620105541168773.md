Last quick post before I&#8217;m off the net and computer for a week&#8230; wow just noticed I my post yesterday night was really early this morning, so it&#8217;s two posts in one day. Anyway house tension is tense at the moment. Everyone is on the edge and annoyed with one another, or at least maybe one other person. Is it normal? Back into my thinking moods again since yesterday. A week away, I hope I don&#8217;t think for the whole of it&#8230; that would be shitty. Hopefully everything will be all good when I come back&#8230; it probably will be. Anyways over and out, I&#8217;ll bring back my stories of the South Pacific next Sunday maybe around 10am onwards&#8230;
