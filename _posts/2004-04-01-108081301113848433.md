Few hours since last post. Actually feeling kind of better now. It&#8217;s really weird, like 2 years on. Today was just weird. I just suddenly have an overwhelming number of thoughts, feelings, emotions all hit me at the one time. I guess the difference is now I know it&#8217;ll pass kind of an up and down wave, with long periods of calm in the middle of the next. Funny how when I write out my inner thoughts and feelings, I&#8217;m alot more expressive and passionate about what I write.

To anyone who read the previous stuff, don&#8217;t worry about me I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to do anything stupid. I guess I figure doing stupid stuff doesn&#8217;t really fix the problem&#8230; it makes those feelings channel into some other part, but after the feeling goes away your still stuck in the same old hole. The window is open and I can hear and feel the air, that is enough.
