Apart from having Period 0 today, and my head still slightly swaying from side to side like I&#8217;m on a ship sailing the high seas, the first day back at school has been pretty okay suprisingly. I got my last IPT assessment back which was pretty cool, but we have a test next week so I better brush up on Info Systems and Databases sometime soon.
