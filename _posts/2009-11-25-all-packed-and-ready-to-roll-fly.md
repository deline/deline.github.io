excerpt: |
  According to WolframAlpha that is approximately 1 day 18 hours 54 minutes and 26 seconds from now...
  
  Have just the day of work tomorrow then I have Fri off in lieu of last weekend, which is good since I was originally going to have to lug my stuff to work then head from there to the airport.
  
  Will try and blog on the trip, actually it would be rather odd if I didn't right?
  
  Anyways time for sleep, another day awaits and then it's holiday time!
