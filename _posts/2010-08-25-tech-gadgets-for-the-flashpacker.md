excerpt: |
  For want of a better word, I guess I could be termed a flashpacker. Cutting costs here and there is awesome, but a few nice things along the way be it a more comfy bed or hot water is always nice. That and the fact I seem to always cart off with me what seems an enormous amount of cables and gadgets.

  This trip happening in a week and a bit isn't that much different to the last few in terms of gadgets I'm taking, but I am throwing a few more into the mix. The <a href="http://delineneo.com/blog/del/i-3-technology">Eee PC and Skype has saved me in the past</a> and this time round I'll be relying on it plus a bunch of other gadgets to get me through the trip and help me keep in touch, pay bills, navigate roads, backup photos etc.

  So in a nutshell... I think the gadget count is going to be something like as follows:
  <ul>
  <li>Eee PC - surf the net, skype, email, blog etc</li>
  <li>Panasonic Lumix FZ35 - not quite an SLR but awesome zoom... and rather large!</li>
  <li>Canon IXUS - smaller point and click for when I don't want to lug the Lumix around</li>
  <li>iPod - music, also a backup for my photos and any trip notes</li>
  <li>iPhone - mainly for keeping in touch via SMS</li>
  <li>Garmin eTrex - don't want to get lost on a trail, maybe some geocaching too?</li>
  <li>Kodak PlaySport - take some video of the car drives and places visited so I can show my mum</li>
  </ul>

  Between now and next weekend I'm also going to try and sort out my user accounts for various things so I can keep pics and hopefully videos coming through to the site whilst away...
