I am so full that it ain&#8217;t funny. Went to this restaurant at Cabarita, it was good, but yeh now awfully full. What&#8217;d we order hmm caesar salad, some prawn entree thingo, some calamari entree thingo, garlic bread, some pasta main, some chicken main, some lamb main, some fish main (some standing for some word I can&#8217;t remember &#8211; lol) and some desert. And we got like this plate of chocolate thingos&#8230; and yeh it was like \*alot\* of food.

In other news, last few days been pretty cruisy, got back into the hang of things&#8230; learnt some new stuff along the way. Mmm you know what? I&#8217;ve got a bad memory when it comes to numbers or stuff like numbers&#8230;
