So in 87 days (no I&#8217;m not counting&#8230; okay maybe just a teeny little bit) we&#8217;ll be heading off for 2 months on what I like to term &#8216;<del>My</del> Our Great Alaskan Adventure&#8217;. Which is a bit of a confusing title seeing we will be spending more time in the Lower 48.

My bucket list includes visiting as many of the U.S. National Parks as I can, and Alaska has been high on that list ever since I first got sucked into the parks system when visiting [Zion National Park](http://delineneo.com/2008/10/zion-national-park/ "Zion National Park") back in 2008.

So in late May we&#8217;ll depart for another road trip adventure (this time with cruise) to tick off (and hike!) the following parks:

  * Glacier Bay NP
  * Denali NP
  * Kenai Fjord NP
  * Olympic NP
  * Mount Rainier NP
  * Crater Lake NP
  * Redwood NP
  * Lassen Volcanic Park

Oh and of course a few days at Disney as I&#8217;m a sucker for that as well.
