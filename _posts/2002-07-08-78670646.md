I haven&#8217;t written here in ages!!! Hmm, well it&#8217;s Monday and it&#8217;s the holidays, and I really should be doing my assignments, but I have homework block today. So I took to redesigning my site. I don&#8217;t know which was better this or the old, but grey looks cool, so this will just have to stay. And for the first time in my life I&#8217;ve designed for 1024 x 768 and above only! That&#8217;s really bad actually, sorry all you 800 x 600-ers but this is staying this way, so resize your resolution ðŸ™‚

Anyway trials are over now&#8230; and we should all be relaxing, but thats a bit hard hey with three huge percentage assessments to complete. So anyway yesterday &#8211; when i was supposed to be doing my EES work!!! &#8211; I went shopping, and got some jeans&#8230;.so now I guess i can hack the semi hacked up ones up. And they have this pink bit on it.(shocking!) but they&#8217;ll be okay&#8230;.I have to break for some lunch or breakfast&#8230;&#8230;.or a combo of both&#8230;.
