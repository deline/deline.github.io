Taking a break from Maths&#8230;..
  
I think my family is weird. It&#8217;s the weekend and my mum&#8217;s gone to work both days and my dad&#8217;s gone fishing today. But then again&#8230; my mum&#8217;s always at work which is why my dad is more like a mum that my mum is a mum. Hell too think about it.. I onyl see my mum say an hour and a bit a day&#8230;. well today so far is like 10 minutes and she probably won&#8217;t be back till like 5-6! Sometimes I wonder&#8230; but I shouldn&#8217;t be wondering rather doing my maths&#8230;. i hate graphs&#8230;
