I been thinking recently, of how life has been great as of late. It&#8217;s not like everything is necessarily running to plan (as it never really does, does it?). But it&#8217;s just like it has been moving along at a very nice pace. And along the way everything I&#8217;ve hoped/dreamed for has more or less happened (so far anyway :-p ). I was thinking just the other day that in some respects I&#8217;ve been pretty lucky in most of the stakes. I wonder where the next month or so will go&#8230; will I achieve another one of my goals/dreams/ambitions&#8230; I&#8217;ll just have to wait and see. It&#8217;s kind of scary/weird in a positive way, as so far, the majority of what I looked towards/aimed for 3 &#8211; 4 years ago has happened in some form or another. 4 years ago I would have said it was impossible and I was just dreaming. But maybe dreams can come true&#8230;
