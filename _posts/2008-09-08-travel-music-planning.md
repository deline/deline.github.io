  Well it's time to revive the blog as the trip looms ahead. Have started copying all my music to the computer to load up my iPod and deciding on playlists to make. With 5 weeks of traveling to happen anything and everything is going on. In shock horror Robbie Williams and the Spice Girls make the cut - there's only so much Snow Patrol and Stereophonics one can listen too unfortunately.

  Anyways for those who may be following the blogging travels, bookmark <a href="http://delineneo.com/category/blog-tags/travelling">this</a>. It'll take you straight to the travelling tagged posts.
