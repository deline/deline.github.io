Well this weekend was part spent hanging out with Snoopy Napier ( :-p ) and the other half (i.e. Sunday) wondering why the weather is so hot, and hoping Tuesday is not like today.

So anyways, on Sat Snoopy and myself headed out to hunt me down a new pair of soccer/football boots. And I&#8217;ve got to mention how I really like the fact I can fit into kids shoes. It&#8217;s pretty awesome &#8216;cos it means you can save an absurd amount on sports related shoes when compared to the female equivalent. E.g. a pair of boots which were the exact same style (though different colour) were a 50% price difference!
