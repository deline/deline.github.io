<pre>Culture sucks down words
Itemise loathing and feed yourself smiles
Organise your safe tribal war
Hurt maim kill and enslave the ghetto

Each day living out a lie
Life sold cheaply forever, ever, ever</pre>

Manic Street Preachers &#8211; [Motorcycle Emptiness](http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=74200)
