Well it&#8217;s 1:37pm and I&#8217;m at uni waiting till 2pm where I have to go to a meeting. Had the first labs today. Was actually pretty good. I think I&#8217;ll enjoy it. \*Cross Fingers\*

Met Sana today (hello! if your reading this). &#8216;Twas cool, yeah just bummed, then saw Lauren so had a chat to her too. Picked up all my lecture notes&#8230; so all is well, and yep.

I should really clean out my IT drive, but its annoying to do so. Probably just download everything on the weekend and burn to CD. Better not lose m DCA stuff, well the code anyway. All that work, and it looked so pretty. Okay so I have a weird fascination with code looking nice when its all indented properly&#8230; and yep it&#8217;s geek speak now.

Anyways bout 15 minutes to waste now, so I&#8217;ll be off on my ways.
