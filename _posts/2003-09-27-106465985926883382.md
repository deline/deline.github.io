Woot! I got my XML and DOM processing stuff to work&#8230; it&#8217;s times like these I really love programming and for a minute there I actually wondered why I didn&#8217;t pick a more programming submajor :-S. But I figure I can learn the programming stuff in my own time, if I&#8217;m really dedicated enough&#8230; But yeah O&#8217;m amazed&#8230; I actually did it myself!!! Ahhh I&#8217;m like happy, content, pleased that I&#8217;ve achieved something. Ahh now I&#8217;m in a mood to code more and fix my comments up and everything else.
