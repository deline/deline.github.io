@$#% some people hey? Just a thoughtless comment from me, won&#8217;t go into detail, not the place or time. My brain is numbless and like a weight and it&#8217;s got that feeling where it wants to sink to the bottom of the ocean. And it&#8217;s tired even though it&#8217;s had alot of sleep, and I know where this is heading&#8230;

In other news, finally rang up to book in for the x-ray, so going today. And I should remember to claim my free cheeseburger! Should I go to the GP sale tomorrow? GP is pretty crap now, but it&#8217;s something to do and take my mind on stuff I guess.
