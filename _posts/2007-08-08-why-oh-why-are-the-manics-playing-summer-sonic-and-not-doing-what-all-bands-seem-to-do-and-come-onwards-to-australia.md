Like for a minute there, I had hope&#8230; until it was ruined by seeing they were heading back to England&#8230; but if they&#8217;re playing in Greece and Turkey you&#8217;d think there must be a slight chance that they&#8217;ll come out to Australia soon right? (ignoring the fact that Greece and Turkey are on the other side of the world)&#8230;
