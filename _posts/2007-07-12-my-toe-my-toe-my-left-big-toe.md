Has been sore around the toe nail since Sunday (no surprise why really). Apparently it&#8217;s also referred to as [Black Toenail](http://walking.about.com/od/blisterfoot/a/blacktoenail.htm). Which kind of makes sense because it does turn black eventually. But this is the biggest one I&#8217;ve ever got in my life&#8230; And now 4 days later I can actually see it quite clearly under my toe nail. So the question which arises is do I do the heat up the paper clip treatment. It seems a little insane, but then walking on the toe is just as bad.
