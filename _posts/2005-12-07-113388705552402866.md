Having really bad luck with the Internet today. Every computer I&#8217;ve tried has either been really slow or has network issues. So I&#8217;ll be lucky if this even posts.

Caught the overnight train from Delhi to Jaisalmer yesterday. It was 19 hours estimated, but due to more stoppages than normal it was more like 20+. Arrived in Jaisalmer around 2pm today. Jaisalmer is brillant. It&#8217;s a magnificant old city with a huge Fort, and we&#8217;re staying within the Fort. It&#8217;s a very old city, with cobble streets, cows, and it&#8217;s a maze just to navigate within it.

Till laters,

Deline
