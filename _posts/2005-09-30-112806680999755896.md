Well today was great. The sun was shining, the sky was blue and it wasn&#8217;t very windy either. [BridgeClimb](http://www.bridgeclimb.com/) was heaps cool. Even though we were the only non &#8216;real; tourists. Still learnt a few interesting facts about Sydney that I never knew. Then after that it was time for a well deserved lunch followed by a walk up George Street.

Here&#8217;s a pic:
