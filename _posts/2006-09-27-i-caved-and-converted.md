I&#8217;ve officially jumped too the apple bandwagon. I couldn&#8217;t be bothered waiting for zune and i think if the rumours for the 6g one is true the first release will have issues with the screen. Sure proper widescreen would be nice but i&#8217;m kind of against the touchscreen idea. Other than that super tired having to put in a change 2 nights in a row. All i can say is long litm the long weekend.
