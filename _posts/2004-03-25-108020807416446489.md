Argh yesterday when I ran AutoPatcher it screwed my IIS up. But I guess that&#8217;s partly because I&#8217;m running it on XP Home. Anyways so I found this out whilst at uni, as I brought the lappy to do some reading/work on it. So when I came home I spent some time trying to re get IIS to work. After a while of mucking around with W2K and XP Home CD&#8217;s it eventually did&#8230; \*sigh\*.

So after that I&#8217;ve just been playing with Contribute. Mmm I read about this before and always wanted to try it, but never got around to d/l the trial. Anyways learning it for work, and it really does look as good as it sounds. Going to have a bit more of a play around on it in the next few weeks. I need to test it on other computers. For the time being mucking around on my ProgSoc space. Don&#8217;t wanna screw around with the WebCentral space and end up doing something horribly drastic&#8230; lol&#8230; Anyways I should go, &#8216;cos I have IT Op tomorrow, and need to do some prep worl for it.
