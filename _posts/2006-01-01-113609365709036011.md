Okay&#8217;s so I&#8217;m back home now. I actually got in yesterday morning, but the day was spent lazying around then going to a friends house for a quiet NYE. But the first thing that hit me was the heat! If yesterday was hot, today beats it by far. According to the [SMH](http://www.smh.com.au) it is currently 45 degrees celsius in Sydney &#8211; and that&#8217;s the coastal temp, so it could very well be a few higher out here. Singapore was like a hundred times cooler than this. It&#8217;s even like way to hot to go to the beach. A 30 second walk outside with thongs as shoes, and my feet were already burning&#8230;
