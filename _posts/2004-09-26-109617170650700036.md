Well I&#8217;ve been out since 9am and got back round 2:40pm ish. Went bike riding/trekking for the better part of the morning then had lunch at Emily&#8217;s house and looked at Thailand stuff then cycled back home. Anyways we rode all the way around to Silverwater and over the bridge, then round to Newington Armoury then through Olympic Park. Stopped for a gelato then cycled back via Bicentennial Park and Rhodes. Hectic. And it was fairly hot on the way back. Looks like next time we should start earlier maybe. Other than that good stuff.
