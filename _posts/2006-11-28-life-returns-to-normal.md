At least I think so. Had the showcase preso for this thing at work today which turned out to be not as bad as we thought it would be. Other than that played OzTag tonight as a fill in player. Looking forward to this weekend though&#8230; camping/caving weekend. Will be good. Which reminds me I need to pack tomorrow night, &#8216;cos Thursday night meet/catch up to sort out water/food/tents/whatnot.
