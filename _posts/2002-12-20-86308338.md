I&#8217;m really hypo. Well not so much more, but I was on a high this morning. I did not think I wuld get that high. Sure Lazseeker spat me out a 98.20 according to if I sat _last years HSC_, but since it was last year&#8217;s I didn&#8217;t trust it&#8230; and also because it seemed that everyone seemed to be getting Band 5&#8217;s and Band 6&#8217;s. I was thinking more round 93 at most&#8230; so you can say I was more than rapt at what I got which is somewhere in the range of 93 to 98. Bu yeh, so my mummy said she&#8217;d buy my Lego (but I said I&#8217;d pay half)&#8230; and I get my daddy&#8217;s car&#8230;. now I just need to learn how to drive&#8230;. dammit.. I&#8217;m a bad driver. But yeh I am heaps happy&#8230; everything I put in this year has been worth it and it paid off.
