excerpt: |
  So I think I've completed the 'Circle of OS' and am now currently sitting in the Mac camp. The decision to make the move to Mac was for a number of factors - curiosity, iPhone OS programming, learning new things, and of course one cannot forget the eye candy that comes with any Apple product.

  As with my move to Linux a couple of years back, there's always the initial confusion with a new OS. And with the Mac there's also the added learning of new keyboard shortcuts! I must be getting somewhere though as it seems I'm in the habit of now pressing the Mac combos at work on my Windows machine!

  Along with all the above is learning Objective-C the Cocoa framework and getting a grasp of the Xcode IDE as hopefully will start playing around with some iPhone dev.
