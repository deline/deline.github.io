So I&#8217;ve had Vista for about a week now, but only the last 2 or so days have I managed to have a proper feel for it. And so far so good. It&#8217;s very nice and pretty in a number of ways. Okay, so it does have fairly high system requirements, but you have the power, RAM and graphics to run it, then that&#8217;s not really an issue. Sidebar is a useful thing for the RSS feeds, but you have to subscribe to them through IE so I do wonder if the feeds update if you don&#8217;t use IE for web surfing. I&#8217;m guessing that the core system files probably has a routine that checks and hopefully the sidebar gadgets and IE both tap into that. Hence the previous post to test the theory out.

Ooh nice&#8230; it looks like it does so, as the previous post has just appeared in the gadget. Windows Flip and Flip 3D are quite useful, except I was surprised that it didn&#8217;t have multiple desktops as a feature. though with Flip 3D it&#8217;s not really an issue as it&#8217;s quick and easy to use the keyboard shortcuts to see what&#8217;s on the various screens.

Though I will admit that some of the features are annoying though as has been quite cleverly pointed out in some of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/getamac/ads/">Get a Mac</a> ads. Hence I&#8217;ve turned of those supposed features to help minimise unwanted stuff being installed etc etc. But other than that I so far have no major complaints&#8230; but we&#8217;ll see what I think in a few weeks&#8230;
