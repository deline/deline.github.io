Since I last posted. What&#8217;s happened since then? Hmm camping/caving, a 10 year primary school reunion a day at the beach with lots of sand, staff end of year thingo&#8230; looks like another year has just gone by.

Other than that, looks like Australia&#8217;s just caught onto the awesomeness that is [PostSecret](http://www.smh.com.au/news/web/the-secrets-service/2006/12/07/1165081202172.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1) (otherwise known as one of my things I semi plug along with Improv Everywhere, Snow Patrol and Stereophonics&#8230; lol). But seriously, the price their stating down the end of the article is overpriced&#8230; hit Kinokuniya in the city if you want it. They were the only bookstore in like the whole of Sydney who actually were useful when I was trying to buy the book way back earlier in the year. So yeah by the import version &#8216;cos it&#8217;s cheaper.

Anyways hope tomorrow&#8217;s weather is cooler&#8230; off to bed now&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;
