First thing to post is that I&#8217;ve spent a whole load of $ on food this week. I haven&#8217;t eaten a proper home cooked meal since Tuesday night, and I&#8217;ve eaten out every lunch since Tuesday (coincidentally as a result of not eating home cooked food). Highlights Wednesday night caught up with the uni dudes for dinner at [Chinta Ria](http://www.chintaria.com/), Friday long lunch with the work guys down at some chinese place in Chinatown. But tomorrow I&#8217;m definatley going to eat at home&#8230; I feel like some roasted vegetables or something&#8230;

Now on the music front&#8230;. next week will be awesome&#8230; 2 gigs/shows on consecutive days&#8230;. Wednesday morning sure will be interesting&#8230;

And now on the nerd front &#8211; here&#8217;s some research on [bloggers/blogging](http://pewresearch.org/reports/?ReportID=36).

Adios for the week&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;
