I&#8217;ve been meaning to post about the souped up washing machine. It&#8217;s so souped up that it deserves to be under the Technology category! So you&#8217;re probably going what does this machine look like? Well this is it:

Now you&#8217;re probably going &#8216;okay that looks like a shiny object of metal&#8217;, but it&#8217;s a Steam Washer + Dryer! As in you can wash clothes and kick straight into a drying cycle. Oh and the fact that it can steam clean clothes is pretty insane. Not to mention that it&#8217;s a front loader and they have crazy cycle times of like 2 hours and 18 minutes for the default cycle (thank goodness for Quick Wash). But yeah that along with the crazy water heating and high spinning options add to the souped up factor.
