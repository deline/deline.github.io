Apparently the snow is absolutley ripping it down in the snowfields. Can&#8217;t wait, 3 days and counting!!! Oh yesterday party was good except for some wannabe loser gatecrashers who couldn&#8217;t get in, so they resorted to egging the house and placing nails under car tyres. Sucked in to them cos a) my brother knows who they are and b) they didn&#8217;t pop the tyres &#8216;cos people are smart and saw the nails before they reverse their car out of the driveway.

Then today bought my brother his birthday present and went to Top Ryde to buy some stuff to lug to the snow. And now here I am&#8230; I probably should go and try to find my clothes to take with me or at least make sure they&#8217;ve been washed but eh&#8230;
