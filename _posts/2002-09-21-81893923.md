Counting the days tick by&#8230; 6 days left and if you count till Wednesday only 4 really, then if you take of Sunday only 3 school days.

Should I become girly??? Hmm yeah right&#8230;. LOL&#8230; um maybe in another 5 years or so. But girly tops are sorta cool&#8230;..especially stripey ones. I need a bag&#8230; a girly bag.

Music is good stuff&#8230; and I want to play it L-O-U-D&#8230;. actually I&#8217;m really hypo these days and feel like I should be in a mosh pit or something. Maybe I should start listening to classical music&#8230;&#8230;..

Back to this maths exam paper&#8230;..
