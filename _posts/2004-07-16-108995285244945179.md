Argh I couldn&#8217;t make it to Meadowbank and back today. I got to the bridge and my knees felt awfully tired and sore alot earlier than usual (normally I can make the loop trip back to the same spot) and it didn&#8217;t seem wise to try to ride the rest, so I rode back up Princes and along Phillip which pretty much made me tired anyway. Was kind of stupid wearing trackky pants and long sleeve shirt when it&#8217;s kind of sunny outside I must add as well.
