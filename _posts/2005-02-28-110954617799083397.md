Well it&#8217;s back to uni today. Both yay and eh&#8230; yay &#8216;cos I&#8217;ve had enough of hols and the eh &#8216;cos I will wish it was the holidays again after a week or so&#8230; (that&#8217;s how it always goes). Today will be interesting, I have an elective which is a first year science subject so that&#8217;ll be fun. And tomorrow I have a lab but I have no idea where the hell I&#8217;m supposed to buy/borrow a lab coat from or where I&#8217;m going to find safety glasses before tomorrow&#8230; wish me luck
