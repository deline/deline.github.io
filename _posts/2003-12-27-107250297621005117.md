Well finally went and bought Salam Pax&#8217;s book/blog thingo. Gonna start reading it in a sec after I finish of this post. Kinda tired today, I think I&#8217;m a bit sunburnt on my bach &#8216;cos it&#8217;s red which is really strange, because I never use to go like that&#8230; and what&#8217;s funnier is cos I had my hair down when I walked to Bondi, theres a white patch in the middle of my top back area. Other than that, I&#8217;m off to read&#8230;
