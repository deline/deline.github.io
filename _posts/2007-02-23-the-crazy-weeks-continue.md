Okay they aren&#8217;t actually that crazy but they have been pretty jammed full. First it was planning holidays then actually going on them. Now it&#8217;s catching up with friends doing courses amongst other happenings in my life. And don&#8217;t get me wrong it&#8217;s not a bad thing i just don&#8217;t recall when i last had so many things happening in my life. Next week I have an abseil course two nights so it continues.

This weekend is starting tonight with a catchup and a lets laugh at how silly the final episode of The O.C. is going to be followed tomorrow by a day out at Roventure in some place i have yet to work out where it exactly is&#8230; Sunday I&#8217;m heading hopefully to the beach assuming the weatherman remains correct with the report!

As for other happenings in my somewhat at the moment crazy life well I don&#8217;t really post much other than the usual mundane posts for the obvious reasons of the persistency of the internet world&#8230;
  
Random side topic there is this guy who is asleep next to me and he keeps falling onto me! Dude if your falling asleep don&#8217;t start falling onto random passengers. Oh he almost just fell of The seat!
