Well today was an okay with a slightly weird twist to it. First I&#8217;ll start with the weird factor. Well today I was on my way up to Mitre 10 to get 54 keys cut and on the way down the driveway to where I parked my car at work, there was a whole bunch of primary school kids walking up. They must&#8217;ve rented the hall for something. Anyways it was my old primary school. So I&#8217;m walking down the driveway and this teacher asks me if I&#8217;m Deline. And I&#8217;m like yep. Anyways it turned out to be the teacher I had when I was in kindergarten which by the way was like 15 years ago!!! Do I look the same as when I was 5?!? &#8216;Twas interesting. She actually looked younger than what I rememeber from when I was 5&#8230; hmmm my memory must be getting confuzzled. Other than that spent 1.5 hours getting the keys cut&#8230; and day was pretty normal.
