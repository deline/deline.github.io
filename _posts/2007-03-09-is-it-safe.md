Just some environmental posting from me. Anyways the smoke is coming from the stack that is being used to remediate the Rhodes peninsula. Its supposed to be the best way but seeing it one wonders if any toxic byproduct is being released into the atmosphere. Not to mention last time i rode down that way it smelt bad.
