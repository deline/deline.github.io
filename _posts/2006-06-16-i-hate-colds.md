[Acute nasopharyngitis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold) also known as the common cold sucks&#8230; having a stuffy and runny nose, tired limbs a sore right ear, tiredness and a lack of appetite is no fun. If it wasn&#8217;t for Veronica Mars being on at 9:30 tonight I would have gone to sleep as soon as I came home from work&#8230; speaking of which, I&#8217;ve moved teams early, so looks like things are going to be hectic for me the next few weeks&#8230;. (and the cold isn&#8217;t exactly helping!).

Ooh&#8230; I also bought a ticket to the [Snow Patrol](http://www.snowpatrol.com) gig in July. Managed to get a standing/floor ticket which is ace &#8216;cos their now sold out. Side message to Em: can&#8217;t wait till your back and we can get squashed in moshes and have our hearing go funny &#8211; I think your right about RHCP and BDO &#8217;07&#8230;

Oh yeah go the Socceroos in Sunday&#8217;s match!
