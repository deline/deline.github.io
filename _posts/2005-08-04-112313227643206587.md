Wow a week is almost gone already! But it looks like this semester is shaping up to be one \*very\* busy semester. Each subject has 3 assignments and the first batch is due in like 3 weeks!!! But in a way I&#8217;m happy about it all. I&#8217;m looking forward to finishing uni, going on my trip and then starting work. It&#8217;s like the light at the end of the tunnel in a weird twisted sort of way. In regards to the trip, I have to book it this weekend&#8230; I thought I&#8217;d be able to get a flight easily, but its becoming immensely difficult. The plan is to fly out roughly as soon as exams finish to Delhi, India, then join a tour and check out some places that are on my list of &#8216;To see before I&#8217;m 30 list&#8217;. Then around end December / start of Jan leave from Kolkata (Calcutta), India to Singapore then see what happens. I&#8217;d like to make a side trip back to Bangkok if possible but we&#8217;ll see about that. Or maybe Hong Kong? The come back round mid Jan.

Well that&#8217;s at least my plan, I hope it eventuates but one doesn&#8217;t really know what happens in the spate of 5 and a half months do they? But yeah&#8230;

Mmm oh as for my reading spree, it&#8217;s turning back into a text book reading event. A lot of research material to analyse this semester.
