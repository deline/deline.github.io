I was reading an article linked from a Travel Newsletter I receive in my email every week, and there was the following sentence &#8211; &#8220;The problem with travel is that it makes you realise how much you haven&#8217;t seen &#8211; and how much you don&#8217;t know&#8221;. And the thing is, it actually is true to some extent. For me, the more I see/experience other parts of the world, the stronger the urge burns inside me to keep seeing more when I come back home.

But the thing is, for most of us, we can&#8217;t base our life around travel. It&#8217;s not sustainable nor financially secure in the long run. Which of course makes me wonder what&#8217;s better &#8211; having a secure future or seeing/experiencing the world? It&#8217;s hard to make the choice. In a really glossed over manner, it really comes down to: work hard, earn money, not see much OR work normal, earn enough to survive, see things&#8230;

Got the travel bug and I don&#8217;t know what to do&#8230;
