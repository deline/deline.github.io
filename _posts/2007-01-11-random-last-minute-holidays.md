As in, in about 3 weeks and a day I&#8217;ll be in [Phnom Penh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phnom_Penh), Cambodia. It was a really random spur of the moment decision I decided upon last week which resulted in me booking airline tickets earlier this evening. I didn&#8217;t even have a guide/travel book till yesterday afternoon >.< But I'm really excited, 'cos I have a [fascination with Asia](http://delineneo.com/about/) and it&#8217;s definitely a place I want to see (along with Laos, Bhutan, China and more of India). Being last minute and all I had a few problems sorting the flights out.

Long story cut short, for my plans to work out I needed an [open jaw ticket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-jaw_ticket). Even though Singapore flies out of Siem Reap every day, no matter how hard I tried I could not get a flight out of Cambodia on an open jaw even though the flights that fly out we&#8217;re available. I even rang up the airline, and the guy was like oh there&#8217;s no flights out that day&#8230; but then when I asked him to tell me every day they fly out and the times, there was a flight for each day. So then I was going to fly Jetstar from Singapore to Cambodia. But then today flight availability out of Sydney was sketchy &#8216;cos there was this special on which ends tomorrow and all the flights I had planned for yesterday the system told me no longer were available. But lucky some in the afternoon came available. Until I found out that the Jetstar tickets went up $10 and combined with airport tax, because I actually had to check out and recheck in for the budget carrier turned out to be more expensive than spending an extra day in Siem Reap (which I didn&#8217;t want to do &#8216;cos I have a tight schedule). But since I couldn&#8217;t get a flight out of Singapore till the 18th, it all worked out cheaper flying Singapore Airlines.

So all in all, I&#8217;m into Phnom Penh on the 2nd of Feb and leaving Siem Reap on the 14th. Between those dates I&#8217;ll make my way up to Siem Reap (seeing I have to leave from there anyway), and hopefully have time to take a boat trip down the [Tonle Sap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonle_Sap) to [Battambang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battambang) but I think water levels play a part there so we&#8217;ll see.

Excited and freaked at the randomness of it all&#8230; ðŸ˜€
