excerpt: |
  So we've checked out of our hotel and are kind of lazying around not doing much. Our ride back to Lao Cai to catch the train isn't till 4:30pm though. Could've done another walk and was slightly toying with getting a moto out to Thac Bac (Silver Waterfall) and walking to the fall but it's a bit out of town and the weather today is rather gloomy. It's definitely winter weather today as the town is covered in fog and visibility is under 15 metres. Asked a few locals and with this kind of weather the fog stays around all day. So not really the kind of weather to be trekking/walking up hills down stairs and all. Nice weather to be holed up in a cafe with coffee/tea and a book... except that I've finished my book and most of the books available in Sapa are in French... Maybe I'll try and get one in Hanoi or trade mine in...
  
  Anyways going to finish my tea and decide what to do... it's kind of a really small town and you can walk from one side to another in like 10 minutes or so... maybe I should go buy a knock off North Face jacket... (except I don't want to carry it around for the next 2 weeks...)...
  
  Next stop Hanoi for 2 days then it's onwards to Laos!
