Hmm well I&#8217;ve actually had a pretty good week. Work has been good, and I&#8217;ve learnt bits and pieces here and there which is cool, &#8216;cos its different and yeah. Yesterday I met up wil Sal for the last time (for the timebeing), as she went back to Coffs today. Hopefully I&#8217;ll catch up with her in the not too distant future. Maybe a trek up north for me? Who knows what the future holds&#8230;

Have I mentioned how much I love shorts? Long knee length shorts are nice&#8230; don&#8217;t stick to you so its not all yuck when the weather is hot. I&#8217;ve lived the last 2 weeks in shorts&#8230; ahhh benefits of wear I work&#8230; can go in whatever clothes I want&#8230; pity the day I have to get a really job really, as it will be a very big change for me. Have thought about the future much recently&#8230; other more interesting things happening at the moment. Maybe I&#8217;ll start seriously thinking around June &#8211; July?

Anyways I&#8217;m off on Sunday afternoon, so I&#8217;ll probably do a quick post before I go. How long do you reckon a digital camera battery lasts??? Stupid that you can&#8217;t recharge it on ship&#8230; grrr
