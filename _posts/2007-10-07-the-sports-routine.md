So apparently if OzTag works out, my sport schedule will be a somewhat nutty first 2 days of the week&#8230;

  * Monday &#8211; Indoor soccer during lunch, then in the evening OzTag
  * Tuesday &#8211; Touch Football during lunch

I think by Wednesday I will be slightly exhausted&#8230; oh well good fun all round and it&#8217;s exercise. And since the weather&#8217;s warming up it&#8217;ll be all nice too.
