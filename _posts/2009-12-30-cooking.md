excerpt: |
  Just finished a one day cooking course and I am totally full that I don't know if I can manage grilled fish on a stick. The cuorse was really good and we cooked stacks of food.

  On the internet at the moment checking in for my flights home. Gotta check in now so that I can get a aisle seat and top deck seat for the A380.

  Going to hover around town tomorrow before heading of to the airport mid afternoon. Hopefully Hanoi traffic isn't too bad and I'm back at my hotel before 7pm. Going to try and have a nice meal (unfortunatley by myself), then hopefully the night market is open as there's some things I wouldn't mind looking for. Maybe will check out the lake area as well and see what is happening for NYE.

  That's it for now... see you from Hanoi (or breakfast tomorrow maybe?)
