Well first things first, I actually got a reply from the manager of Bunnings. I was up in the air over whether or not, as most often website feedback gets ignored by the big corporations, but then on the other hand I wrote a pretty damn fine letter (or so I think). Secondly I went to the Careers Fair today. It was okay crowded, spoke to a few people from various companies. Some made me still feel inspired to apply, one in particular I walked away un-inspired thinking I don&#8217;t really want to work for that company. I don&#8217;t know, in that particular instance the person/people I was talking to didn&#8217;t seem motivating. One of the people I spoke to was some guy from the DET at the Teach.NSW stand. He was pretty okay, well I was the only person talking to him, but eh he didn&#8217;t make me change my mind any less about considering it so I suppose that was okay. Anyways I gotta go sleep, &#8216;cos I have to work tomorrow and it&#8217;s going to be a hectic day of marking &#8216;cos its assessable day&#8230;
