WTF the Baghdad Blogger aka Salam Pax is here in Sydney!!! <http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/19/1084917655026.html>
  
I don&#8217;t belive it&#8230; and dammit he was doing some thing for the Sydney Writers Festival and it is/was on tonight @ Parra&#8230; I so would&#8217;ve gone even if English/Literacy/Writing is not my thing. It certainly explains why his Blog has been on the quiet front recently&#8230;
