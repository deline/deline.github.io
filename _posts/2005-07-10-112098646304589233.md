It&#8217;s been a dark and very windy day, so I have spent the day reading [Man and Boy](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743225082/qid=1120986069/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_ur_1/102-0026276-9224948?v=glance&s=books&n=507846). It was a pretty good book. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;d necessarily call it a great literary read or similar, but it struck a chord with me. Think Nick Hornby and About a Boy. It&#8217;s very, very similar in ways &#8211; man has to grasp happenings of life and grow up and move on with things. But it was good&#8230; I&#8217;d love to see the tv adaptation of it, but unfortunatley it was a UK BBC production so there&#8217;s probably no chance in hopes of it being aired down here. Now time to start on [Where The Truth Lies](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812972236/qid=1120986318/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_ur_1/102-0026276-9224948?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) by Rupert Holmes. This one recently just got made into a movie by Atom Egoyan and received mixed reviews and Cannes.
