Well on Thursday night I went and saw Bodyjar. It was pretty good, should&#8217;ve worn tie-up shoes though, &#8216;cos I lost one of my shoes at one point, but I got it back. Shit thing was, that because it was small it was really pushy/shovey and if you were at the front and little you would&#8217;ve landed on the stage because of all the shoving going on. But other than that was good.

Today went driving, got new tyres etc. Then went to Macquarie and bought a tomato plant and some seedlings. Then when we came home we planted them. Eh so I have weird interests/things which amuse me&#8230;
