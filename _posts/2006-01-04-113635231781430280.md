So so, what&#8217;s been happening&#8230; well I&#8217;ve bought myself a nice black looking [external DVD burner](http://au.lge.com/md/product/prodcategorylist.do?actType=detail&currPage=1&categoryId=1000000084&parentCategoryId=0200000602&categoryLevel=4&productId=1100000712). When shopping for it I had to decide between the [LightScribe](http://www.lightscribe.com/) and non-LightScribe version as there was a significant price difference as the non-LightScribe was on sale (and is cheaper anyways)&#8230; But for some reason, my dad talked me into buying the LightScribe one&#8230; purely &#8216;cos of the aesthetics and coolness of being able to create laser etched designs on the CD (you know instead of using markers to label them and so on). And I&#8217;ve got the urge of late to start coding&#8230; both for fun and to get my brain working. Thinking of an online CD database/directory which I can search/add my collection too&#8230;

As for the weather, well it&#8217;s decided to be shitty weather, grey and overcast&#8230; hopefully I&#8217;ll make it to the beach in the next few days though. Meh&#8230; CTP insurance bill just came and it&#8217;s gone up by almost $200&#8230; its like just over half a grand. Argh&#8230; to keep or not to keep my car&#8230;
