Have I been really subdued and too myself recently? I don&#8217;t really know that answer. The last couple of days &#8211; in particular today &#8211; I&#8217;ve felt as if I&#8217;m locking myself up again. Nowhere like before, but I know so &#8216;cos of stuff I&#8217;m thinking about&#8230; and also because of other indicators I&#8217;ve come to notice like playing the piano&#8230; and stuff I listen too. I&#8217;m hoping they go away in the next couple of days&#8230; or at least stay the way they are now. I can handle that&#8230; I think.
  
But to change the topic now&#8230; yesterday we got our digital camera. A Canon G2. It&#8217;s heaps cool. The only thing about it that sucks is that unlike the other PowerShots, and the IXUS, it doesn&#8217;t fit into a pocket and isn&#8217;t that light&#8230; which is shitty in a way as it means you have to lug it around. But then again its SLR like, so I guess thats why theres the extra size and weight, But I like how the LCD turns around&#8230; amongst other stuff. I went snap happy last night taking nothing in particular, actually I just took some shots so I could use them in Photoshop&#8230; blurry night shots, with swirls of light (those always had me fascinated).
