Today I talked to Year 12 IPT for like a few minutes&#8230; thank god it was a very small class, otherwise I probably would have said even less than I did. And anyways before and after that A.K/M was tellingme how I had/should talk more and step out of my comfort zone&#8230; easier said than done though. And I really do try, but it just doesn&#8217;t happen. Been a quiet kid all my life&#8230;. eh not much has changed.
