So the weather on pretty much the eastern seaboard side of NSW is being hit by rather extreme weather over the last 2 days. Heaps of rain, and today massive winds. It&#8217;s kinda crazy to hear about [collapsing roads](http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/tough-search-for-missing-family/2007/06/08/1181089315886.html) as well as [grounded ships](http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/fears-ship-could-break-up/2007/06/08/1181089282623.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1) like 50m of a beach! And for some reason the weather gods decided everytime I&#8217;d have to walk out of the building to start a torrential downpour.

That and the fact Sydney transport seems to grind to a halt when it rains&#8230; I&#8217;m hoping the wind at least dies down, &#8216;cos it&#8217;s super cold right now&#8230; or it could be a sign it&#8217;s time to go sleep. Meh.
