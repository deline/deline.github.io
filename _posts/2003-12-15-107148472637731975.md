OMFG&#8230; I passed. Can&#8217;t belive it. In previous posts I may have mentioned how each time I got told different things. This time I stuffed half the stuff I was told, and I still managed to pass&#8230; I reckon presence of a &#8216;qualified&#8217; instructor makes a difference. Which i.e. means things are rorted in my books. All up I spent a good few hundren in attempting to pass! >.
