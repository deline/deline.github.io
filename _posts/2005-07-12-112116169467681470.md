Well well, another day another catch up. Met up with a friend today for lunch and a movie. After walking round looking for somewhere to eat &#8216;real&#8217; food that had seats, landed up in the cafe upstairs at Dymocks, then onwards to the movies. Along the way we passed good ole JB Hi-Fi which resulted in excessive amounts of spending (this time not on my part)&#8230; Ended up watching Fantastic Four. Being based around a comic and all, it bore great similarity to Spiderman&#8230; you know scientific experiment of some sorts goes wrong, evil monster creature gets incarnated, good guys have to save world from the hands of evil monster creature. But it was good. Probably better than Spiderman as Fantastic Four had funny moments in it.
