I&#8217;m back! &#8211; after a two month + hiatus. Well I actually was developing another &#8216;business&#8217; site to go here, but I kind of acidentally deleted it. Anyway this is what this space will be now, plain an simple. Don&#8217;t really have time to work on this much now anyway.

Anyways since my last post all that time ago, I&#8217;ve been on mid semster break, got my exam results, and now I am on holidays again &#8211; for one week only &#8211; and I have plan to do lots of work and study. Exam results were alot better than I expected, so I guess you could say I was pretty pleased. Two distinctions and two high distinctions.

Oh, it was my birthday on the weekend. Didn&#8217;t really do much, I guess birthdays kind of diminish as you get older? They just seem like another day in your life really. But thanks to all the people who send me cards/emails/sms&#8217;s/etc.
