  In Prague and it's grey and rainy all round. I suppose that's Europe getting to winter weather. Or telling us it is...

  Anyway quick post as there is only one computer in this hostel for everyone and it is kind of very slow...

  Maybe even the last post till I return.... I figure easyHotels don't have easy internet access... not at 15 euro a night...
