Long time no blog. Well since last time, I finally got that last OOP line. I put my mind to it and it &#8216;clicked&#8217;, I really had it all along, just probably was procrastinating over having to code it.
  
Went and saw The Matrix Reloaded last night. &#8216;Twas good the movie that is. Was kinda weird before &#8216;cos I didn&#8217;t know no one, and yeah usual feelings of lack of control, emotion, wish I could shrink into the corner. But it was good in the end =) Thanks to my buddy who ran up and got the ticket for me (in the rain) &#8211; sorry bout your stuffed knee now&#8230;.
  
Oh yeah, I also got my accounting assignment back, 25/25 &#8211; woot!!! It too me so long to do I don&#8217;t know if I actually remember everything. That&#8217;s why I got it finished good anywayz, I spent like a month doing it possibly more and redid it 20+ times cos of dumb mistakes as I worked things out. Still pretty happy, but gotta revise for the exam. I&#8217;d love to D or HD ICC and PDC. I&#8217;ve given up HD-ing OOP, because I have to prioritiese, I have compulsary Networking exam the day its due as well as compulsary assignment due, whereas the OOP HD assignment is not compulsary. And of course I like writing about information systems and databases, serach engines kinda things which people find boring&#8230;&#8230; anyways back to it..
