[Wired News: CardSystems&#8217; Data Left Unsecured](http://wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,67980,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_1) Well I guess the said company is probably going to have a hard time regaining it&#8217;s customers as well as it&#8217;s image after this. I don&#8217;t know, I guess that maybe because the company failed compliance the first time doesn&#8217;t make it so much of a surprise, but it does bring up issues in itself. And I guess it shows the importance of quality assurance and the need for auditing. Is an audit each year on companies repsonsible for our credit details really enough? Would it be more effective to be twice a year? or even quartley? The logistics and costs involved would definatley be high, but at the stake of millions of lost/stolen customer details, we have to weigh up the possible benefits. Food for thought really&#8230;
