I have to ask&#8230; who is on Bigpond using Win 98, IE 6 and from **147.10.132.187**???

Well the IP is irrelevant as it&#8217;s probably dynamic anyway. But it def

is a Telstra ip addy (traceroute it). With my psyhic (that is spelt

wrong isn&#8217;t it???) BTW totally offtopic but this remined me, everyone

should move to Mozilla! Or Firefox (is mozilla based). I thought tabbed

browsing was annoying, but it&#8217;s actually heaps good. And it crashes

less than IE. Oh and Thunderbird for email. It&#8217;s not clunky and the

built in spam filter thingo actually kinda works.

Also only posting it now because I guess it&#8217;s something I feel like

posting about, but life is short isn&#8217;t it? And do you reckon the saying

that &#8216;only the good die young&#8217; or whatever the saying is holds true? In

some respects I reckon it is.

Blah oh last night I pulled the $20 voucher thingo of my spindle of

CD&#8217;s and claimed it. Not many choices for $20 once postage was

included, so had to choose between Foo Fighters, One by One or

Punkorama Vol 9. Chose the latter as I didn&#8217;t particularly like One by

One that much when I heard it.
