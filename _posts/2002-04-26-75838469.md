_So why don&#8217;t you slide?_ Yeah if it was that simple to escape from everything, you know we&#8217;ll just &#8216;slide&#8217; away into the ether. Maybe it&#8217;s &#8216;cos school is going back on Tuesday, but I doubt that&#8230; it&#8217;s back in those dark days again when all you really feel like doing is lying in bed with the sheets pulled over you head forever and ever, in darkness, silence and peace.
