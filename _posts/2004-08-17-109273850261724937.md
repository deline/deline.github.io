It&#8217;s raining it&#8217;s pouring and it actually feels like winter. I&#8217;d forgotten how much I love the weather when its gloomy, coldish and raining. There&#8217;s a sense of darkness, and the smell of rain is nice.

In a little less than 2 days (counting from the time now), I will have all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed. All removed in one hit under a GA. I hope everything turns out okay, minus the brain cells that will get killed in the process üôÅ And in a week I&#8217;ll be &#8216;half way to 40&#8217;&#8230; a somewhat point in my life when I start to realise how old I&#8217;m getting. Think about it, in another 10 years I&#8217;ll then only be 10 years away from 40!. And I can remember 10 years ago which doesn&#8217;t seem so far back.
