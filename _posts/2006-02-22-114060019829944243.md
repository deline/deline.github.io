My new name for yesterday and today has been Q as in the letter Q. Courtesy to a somehow warped bank account name, my first name isn&#8217;t what it is to the bank which made for weird convos when they rang. Ironically they rang wanting to sell me products. One&#8217;s that they can make money &#8211; e.g. credit cards! &#8211; but in the end I think (?) I ended up getting the better deal&#8230; New online account with no fees, unlimited internet transactions AND i can bpay straight from it. Better part is since it&#8217;s with the same bank as my current saving&#8217;s the accounts are linked, so transfers will be immediate unlike my current setup. But that&#8217;s not the good part&#8230; the better part is no more $5 monthly fee for the life of the account. Woot! Yay to work benefits&#8230; and unlimited transactions.
