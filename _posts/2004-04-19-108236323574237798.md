        You Are An Introvert!
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        You&#8217;re not necessarily anti-social, but you do tend to need a lot of alone time.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        You tend to think before you talk, which doesn&#8217;t make you the loudest person in the room.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        While you aren&#8217;t outgoing, you are a good listener &#8211; and you tend to be a loyal friend.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        And you enjoy your friends as much as any extrovert does, in smaller doses.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        You&#8217;re more of a conversation over dinner type than a party animal&#8230; and so are all your friends..

          Oh got a new birdy today. Me and Calv went looking for one. He wants to call it Jack, but it&#8217;s gonna be called Gonzo! Hmm but he has mites of something, so gonna go back tomorrow and tell them, and find some stuff to rid them (before they transfer to me when I play with him). Ahh yeah as for the quiz, eh well what do you know&#8230;
