I found it! Found what you ask? The pest that is eating my vegetables that I&#8217;m growing. After two trips out yesterday night with a torch to catch the culprit to no avail, I went out this morning before I left for uni, and caught them feeding&#8230; What&#8217;s them? The [cabbage worm](http://images.google.com/images?q=cabbage%20worm&hl=en&lr=&sa=N&tab=wi) &#8211; coincidentally enough a pest which attacks only cabbage / kale type of plants. At least my mission was accomplished before my vegies got totally defoliated&#8230;
