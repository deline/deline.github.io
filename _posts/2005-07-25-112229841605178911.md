Okay a bit of random stupidity. Hybrid dogs that are specially bred result in very funny names imo. Labradoodle I can handle, but the names schnoodle, spoodle and groodle just make me laugh out loud. Imagine a conversation: &#8216;what kind of dog do you have&#8217;&#8230; &#8216;um I have a groodle&#8217;&#8230;.
