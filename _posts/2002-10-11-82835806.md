Why do I always feel uneasy about English? Just another one of those questions with no answers. But it does worry me sometimes, because both the units count! Damn how the old HSC would&#8217;ve been cooler, &#8216;cos only 1 had to count at minimum. I finished summarising for IPT today. 42 pages typed. About to finish SDD off tonight, so I better get back to _the recognition of a range of different basic building blocks&#8230;_
