I fell down the stairs last night. Was really funny&#8230; like a chimpmunk falling down the stairs. I think the security guard thought I was drunk, which I wasn&#8217;t as I can&#8217;t drink until my mouth heals anyway. And afterwards I laughed but it started making my jaw hurt as I could feel the stiches stretching. I think explains why the lower right site is a bit sore today, and oozing a bit. Weird though, cos on Thurs/Fri it was the left side. Hope it gets better. Starting to look like an ogre (think Shrek). I need real food&#8230; not this mushy goodness that reminds me of baby food.
